<h3>
PART I.
<br /><br />
ON BOARD THE VANCOUVER.
</h3>

<p>
I am going to write, not the history of my
life, which, on the whole, has been as quiet
as most men's, but simply the story of about
a year of it, which, I think, will be almost
as interesting to other folks as any yarn spun
by a professional novel writer; and if I am
wrong, it is because I haven't the knowledge
such have of the way to tell a story.  As a
friend of mine, who is an artist, says, I know
I can't put in the foreground properly, but if
I tell the simple facts in my own way, it will
be true, and anything that is really true
always seems to me to have a value of its
own, quite independent of what the papers
call "style," which a sailor, who has never
written much besides a log and a few
love-letters, cannot pretend to have.  That is
what I think.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Our family&mdash;for somehow it seems as if I
must begin at the beginning&mdash;was always
given to the sea.  There is a story that my
great-grandfather was a pirate or buccaneer;
my grandfather, I know, was in the Royal
Navy, and my father commanded a China
clipper when they used to make, for those
days, such fast runs home with the new
season's tea.  Of course, with these examples
before us, my brother and I took the same
line, and were apprenticed as soon as our
mother could make up her mind to part
with her sons.  Will was six years older
than I, and he was second mate in the vessel
in which I served my apprenticeship; but,
though we were brothers, there wasn't much
likeness either of body or mind between us;
for Will had a failing that never troubled
me, and never will; he was always fond of
his glass, a thing I despise in a seaman, and
especially in an officer, who has so many lives
to answer for.
</p>

<p>
In 1881, when I had been out of my
apprenticeship for rather more than four years,
and had got to be mate by a deal of hard
work&mdash;for, to tell the truth, I liked practical
seamanship then much better than navigation
and logarithms&mdash;I was with my brother
in the <i>Vancouver</i>, a bark of 1100 tons
register.  If it hadn't been for my mother, I
wouldn't have sailed with Will, but she was
always afraid he would get into trouble
through drink; for when he was at home
and heard he was appointed to the command
of this new vessel, he was carried to bed a
great deal the worse for liquor.  So when he
offered me the chief officer's billet, mother
persuaded me to take it.
</p>

<p>
"You must, Tom," she said; "for my sake,
do.  You can look after him, and perhaps
shield him if anything happens, for I am in
fear all the time when he is away, but if you
were with him I should be more at ease; for
you are so steady, Tom."
</p>

<p>
I wasn't so steady as she thought, I dare
say, but still I didn't drink, and that was
something.  Anyhow, that's the reason why
I went with Will, and it was through him
and his drinking ways that all the trouble
began that made my life a terror to me, and
yet brought all the sweetness into it that a
man can have, and more than many have a
right to look for.
</p>

<p>
When we left Liverpool we were bound
for Melbourne with a mixed cargo and
emigrants; and I shouldn't like to say which was
the most mixed, what we had in the hold or
in the steerage, for I don't like such a human
cargo; no sailor does, for they are always in
the way.  However, that's neither here nor
there, for though Will got too much to drink
every two days or so on the passage out,
nothing happened then that has any concern
with the story.  It was only when we got to
Sandridge that the yarn begins, and it began
in a way that rather took me aback; for
though I had always thought Will a man who
didn't care much for women, or, at any rate,
enough to marry one, our anchor hadn't been
down an hour before a lady came off in a
boat.  It was Will's wife, as he explained to
me in a rather shamefaced way when he
introduced her, and a fine-looking woman she
was&mdash;of a beautiful complexion with more
red in it than most Australians have, two
piercing black eyes, and a figure that would
have surprised you, it was so straight and
full.
</p>

<p>
She shook hands with me very firmly, and
looked at me in such a way that it seemed
she saw right through me.
</p>

<p>
"I am very pleased to see you, Mr. Ticehurst,"
she said; "I know we shall be friends,
you are so like your brother."
</p>

<p>
Now, somehow, that didn't please me, for
I could throw Will over the spanker boom if
I wanted to; I was much the bigger man of
the two; and as for strength, there was no
comparison between us.  Besides&mdash;however,
that doesn't matter; and I answered her
heartily enough, for I confess I liked her
looks, though I prefer fair women.
</p>

<p>
"I am sure we shall," said I; "my brother's
wife must be, if I can fix it so."
</p>

<p>
And with that I went off and left them
alone, for I thought I might not be wanted
there; and I knew very well I was wanted
elsewhere, for Tom Mackenzie, the second
Officer, was making signs for me to come on deck.
</p>

<p>
After that I saw her a good deal, for we
were often together, especially when she came
down once or twice and found Will the worse
for liquor.  The first time she was in a
regular fury about it, and though she didn't say
much, she looked like a woman who could
do anything desperate, or even worse than
that.  But the next time she took it more
coolly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Tom," she said, "he was to take
me to the theater, but now he can't go.  What
am I to do?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said I, foolishly enough,
as it seemed, but then I didn't want to take
the hint, which I understood well enough.
</p>

<p>
"Hum!" she said sharply, looking at me
straight.  I believe I blushed a little at being
bowled out, for I was I knew that.  However,
when she had made up her mind, she
was not a woman to be baulked.
</p>

<p>
"Then I know, Tom, if you don't," she
said; "you must take me yourself.  I have
the tickets.  So get ready."
</p>

<p>
"But, Helen!" I said, for I really didn't
like to go off with her in that way without
Will's knowing.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes sparkled, and she stamped her foot.
</p>

<p>
"I insist on it!  So get ready, or I'll go
by myself.  And how would Will like that?"
</p>

<p>
There was no good resisting her, she was
too sharp for me, and I went like a lamb,
doing just as she ordered me, for she was a
masterful woman and accustomed to have her
own way.  If I did wrong I was punished for
it afterward, for this was the beginning of a
kind of flirtation which I swear was always
innocent enough on my side, and would have
been on hers too, if Will had not been a
coward with the drink.
</p>

<p>
In Melbourne we got orders for San Francisco,
and it was only a few days before we
were ready to sail that I found out Helen was
going with us.  I was surprised enough any
way, for I knew the owners objected to their
captains having their wives on board, but I
was more surprised that she was ready to
come.  I hope you will believe that, for it is
as true as daylight.  I thought at first it was
all Will's doing, and he let me think so, for
he didn't like me to know how much she
ruled him when he was sober.  However, she
came on board to stay just twenty-four hours
before we sailed; the very day Will went up
to Melbourne to ship two men in place of
two of ours who had run from the vessel.
</p>

<p>
Next morning, when we were lying in the
bay, for we had hauled out from the wharf
at Sandridge, a boat ran alongside just at six
o'clock, and the two men came on board.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you, and where are you from?"
I asked roughly, for I didn't like the look of
one of them.
</p>

<p>
"These are the two hands that Captain
Ticehurst shipped yesterday from a
Williamstown boarding house," said the runner
who was with them.
</p>

<p>
I always like to ship men from the Sailor's
Home, but I couldn't help myself if Will
chose to take what he could get out of a
den of thieves such as I knew his place to be.
</p>

<p>
"Very well!" said I gruffly enough.
"Look alive, get your dunnage forward and
turn to!"
</p>

<p>
One of them was a hard-looking little
Cockney, who seemed a sailor every inch,
though there weren't many of them; but the
other was a dark lithe man, with an evil
face, who looked like some Oriental half-caste.
</p>

<p>
"Here," said I to the Cockney, "what's
your name?"
</p>

<p>
"Bill Walker, sir," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"Who's the man with you?  What is
he?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Dunno, sir," said Walker, looking forward
at the figure of his shipmate, who was just
disappearing in the fo'c'sle; "I reckon he's
some kind of a Dago, that's what he is, some
kind of a Dago."
</p>

<p>
Now, a Dago in sailor's language means,
as a rule, a Frenchman, Spaniard, or Greek,
or anyone from southern Europe, just as a
Dutchman means anyone from a Fin down
to a real Hollander; so I wasn't much wiser.
However, in a day or two Bill Walker came
up to me and told me, in a confidential
London twang, that he now believed Matthias,
as he called himself, was a half-caste Malay,
as I had thought at first.  But I was to know
him better afterward, as will be seen before
I finish.
</p>

<p>
Now, it is a strange thing, and it shows
how hard it is for a man not accustomed
to writing, like myself, to tell a story in the
proper way, that I have not said anything
of the passengers who were going with us to
San Francisco.  I could understand it if I
had been writing this down just at the time
these things happened, but when I think
that I have put the Malay before Elsie
Fleming, even if he came into my life first,
I am almost ready to laugh at my own
stupidity.  For Elsie was the brightest,
bonniest girl I ever saw, and even now I find it
hard not to let the cat out of the bag before
the hour.  As a matter of fact, this being the
third time I have written all this over, I had
to cut out pages about Elsie which did not
come in their proper place.  So now I shall
say no more than that Elsie and her sister
Fanny, and their father, took passage with us
to California, as we were the only sailing
vessel going that way; and old Fleming,
who had been a sailor himself, fairly hated
steamboats&mdash;aye, a good deal worse than I
do, for I think them a curse to sailors.  But
when they came on board I was busy as a
mate is when ready to go to sea, and though
I believe I must have been blind, yet I hardly
took any notice of the two sisters, more than
to remark that one had hair like gold and a
laugh which was as sweet as a fair wind up
Channel.  But I came to know her better
since; though in a way different from the Malay.
</p>

<p>
When we had got our anchor on board,
and were fairly out to sea, heading for
Bass's Straits, I saw her and Helen talking
together, and I think it was the contrast
between the two that first attracted me
toward her, not much liking dark women,
being dark myself.  She seemed, compared
with Will's wife, as fair as an angel from
heaven, though the glint of her eyes, and her
quick, bright ways, showed she was a woman
all over.  I took a fancy to her that moment,
and I believe Helen saw it, when I think
over what has happened since, for she
frowned and bit her lip hard, until I could
see a mark there.  But I didn't know then
what I do now, and besides, I had no
time to think about such things just then,
for we were hard at it getting things shipshape.
</p>

<p>
Tom Mackenzie, the second officer, and
a much older man than myself&mdash;for he had
been to sea for seventeen years before he
took it into his head to try for his second
mate's ticket&mdash;came up to me when the men
were mustered aft.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Ticehurst," said he gruffly, "I should
be glad if you'd take that Malay chap in
your watch, for I have two d&mdash;d Dagos
already, who are always quarreling, and if
I have three, there will be bloodshed for
sure.  I don't like his looks."
</p>

<p>
"No more do I," I answered; "but I don't
care for his looks.  I've tamed worse looking
men; and if you ask it, Mackenzie, why I'll
have him and you can take the Cockney."
</p>

<p>
I think this was very good of me, for Bill
Walker, I could see, was a real smart hand,
and a merry fellow, not one of those
grumblers who always make trouble for'ard, and
come aft at the head of a deputation once
a week growling about the victuals.  But
Mackenzie was a good sort, and though he
was under me, I knew that for practical
seamanship&mdash;though I won't take a back
seat among any men of my years at sea&mdash;he
was ahead of all of us.  So I was ready
to do him a good turn, and it was true
enough he had two Greeks in his watch
already.
</p>

<p>
When we had been to sea about a week,
and got into the regular routine of work,
which comes round just as it does in a house,
for it is never done, Will got into his routine,
too, and was drunk every day just as regular
as eight bells at noon.  Helen came to me,
of course.
</p>

<p>
"Tom, can't you do something?" she said,
with tears in her eyes, the first time I ever
saw them there, though not the last.  "It is
horrible to think of his drinking this way!
And then before those two girls&mdash;I am
ashamed of myself and of him!  Can't you
do anything?"
</p>

<p>
"What can I do, Helen?" I asked.  "I
can't take it from him; I can't stave the
liquor, there's too much of it; besides, he is
captain, if he is my brother, and I can't go
against him."
</p>

<p>
"But can't you try and persuade him,
Tom?" and she caught my arm and looked
at me so sorrowfully.
</p>

<p>
"Haven't I done it, Helen!" I answered.
"Do you think I have seen him going to
hell these two years without speaking?  But
what good is it&mdash;what good is it?"
</p>

<p>
She turned away and sat down by Elsie
and Fanny, while just underneath in the
saloon Will was singing some old song
about "Pass the bottle round."  He did,
too, and it comes round quick at a party of one.
</p>

<p>
I can see easily that if I tell everything in
this way I shall never finish my task until I
have a pile of manuscript as big as the log of
a three years' voyage, so I shall have to get
on quickly, and just say what is necessary,
and no more.  And now I must say that by
this time I was in love with Elsie Fleming,
in love as much as a man can be, in love with
a passion that trial only strengthened, and
time could not and cannot destroy.  It was
no wonder I loved her, for she was the fairest,
sweetest maid I ever saw, with long golden
hair, bright blue eyes that looked straight at
one, but which could be very soft too sometimes,
and a neat little figure that made me
feel, great strong brute that I was, as clumsy
as an ox, though I was as quick yet to go
aloft as any young man if occasion called for
the mate to show his men the way.  And
when we were a little more than half across
the Pacific to the Golden Gate, I began to
think that Elsie liked me more than she did
anyone else, for she would often talk to me
about her past life in sunny New South
Wales, and shiver to think that her father
might insist on staying a long time in British
Columbia, for he was going to take possession
of a farm left him by an old uncle near a place
called Thomson Forks.
</p>

<p>
It was sweet to have her near me in the
first watch, and I cursed quietly to myself
when young Jack Harmer, the apprentice,
struck four bells, for at ten o'clock she always
said, "Good-night, Mr. Ticehurst.  I must go
now.  How sleepy one does get at sea!  Dear
me, how can you keep your eyes open?"  And
when she went down it seemed as if the moon
and stars went out.
</p>

<p>
When it was old Mackenzie's first watch I
was almost fool enough to be jealous of her
being with him then, though he had a wife at
home, and a daughter just as old as Elsie, and
he thought no more of women, as a rule, than
a hog does of harmony, as I once heard an
American say.  Still, when I lay awake and
heard her step overhead, for I knew it well, I
was almost ready to get up then and there
and make an unutterable fool of myself by
losing my natural sleep.
</p>

<p>
And now I am coming to what I would
willingly leave out.  I hope that people won't
think badly of me for my share in it, for
though I was not always such a straight
walker in life as some are, yet I would not do
what evil-minded folks might think I did.
Somehow I have a difficulty in putting it
down, for though I have spoken of it
sometimes sorrowfully enough to one who is very
dear to me, yet to write it coolly on paper
seems cowardly and treacherous.  And yet,
seeing that I can harm no one, and knowing
as I do in my heart that I wasn't to blame, I
must do it, and do it as kindly as I can.
This is what I mean: I began to see that
Helen loved me more than she should have
done, and that she hated Will bitterly, but
Elsie even worse.
</p>

<p>
It was a great surprise to me, for, to tell
the truth, women as a general rule have
never taken to me very much, and Will was
always the one in our family who had most
to do with them.  And for my part, until I
saw Elsie I never really loved anyone,
although, like most men, I have had a few
troubles which until then I thought
love-affairs.  So it was very hard to convince
myself that what I suspected was true, even
though I believe that I have a natural fitness
for judging people and seeing through them,
even women, who some folks say do not act
from reason like men.  However, I don't think
they are much different, for few of us act
reasonably.  But all this has nothing to do with
the matter in hand.  Now, I must confess,
although it seems wicked, that I was a little
pleased at first to think that two women loved
me, for we are all vain, and that certainly
touches a man's vanity, and yet I was sorry
too, for I foresaw trouble unless I was very
careful, though not all the woe and pain which
came out of this business before the end.
</p>

<p>
The first thing that made me suspect
something was wrong, was that Helen almost
ceased to keep Will from the bottle, and she
taunted him bitterly, so bitterly, that if he
had not usually been a good-tempered fellow
even when drunk, he might have turned
nasty and struck her.  And then she would
never leave me and Elsie alone if she could
help it, although she was not hypocrite
enough to pretend to be very fond of her.
Indeed, Elsie said one night to me that she
was afraid Mrs. Ticehurst didn't like her.  I
laughed, but I saw it was true.  Then,
whenever she could, Helen came and walked with
me, and she hardly ever spoke.  It seems to
me now, when I know all, that she was in a
perpetual conflict, and was hardly in her right
mind.  I should like to think that she was not.
</p>

<p>
I was in a very difficult position, as any
man will admit.  I loved Elsie dearly; I was
convinced my brother's wife loved me; and
we were all four shut up on ship-board.  I
think if we had been on land I should have
spoken to Elsie and run away from the
others, but here I could not speak without
telling her more than I desired, or without
our being in the position of lovers, which
might have caused trouble.  For I even
thought, so suspicious does a man get,
that Helen might perhaps have come on
board more on my account than on Will's.
</p>

<p>
All this time we were making very fair
headway, for we had a good breeze astern of
us, and the "Islands" (as they call them in
San Francisco), that is the Sandwich Islands,
were a long way behind us.  If we had
continued to have fine weather, or if Will had
kept sober, or even so drunk that he could
not have interfered in working the ship,
things might not have taken the turn they
did, and what happened between me and the
Malay who called himself Matthias might
never have occurred.  And when I look back
on the train of circumstances, it almost makes
me believe in Fate, though I should be
unwilling to do that; for I was taught by my
mother, a very intelligent woman who read a
great deal of theology, that men have free
will and can do as they please.
</p>

<p>
However, when we were nearing the
western coast of America, Will, who had a
great notion&mdash;a much greater one than I had,
by the way&mdash;of his navigation, began to come
up every day and take his observations with
me, until at last the weather altered so for the
worse, and it came on to blow so hard, that
neither of us could take any more.  Now, if
Will drank enough, Heaven knows, in fine
weather, he drank a deal harder in foul,
though by getting excited it didn't have the
usual effect on him, and he kept about
without going to sleep just where he sat or lay
down.  So he was always on deck, much to
my annoyance, for I could see the men laughing
as he clung to the rail at the break of the
poop, bowing and scraping, like an
intoxicated dancing master, with every roll the
<i>Vancouver</i> made.
</p>

<p>
For five days we had been running by dead
reckoning, and as well as I could make out we
were heading straight for the coast, a good
bit to the nor'ard of our true course.  Besides,
we were a good fifty miles farther east than
Will made out, according to his figures, and I
said as much to him.  He laughed scornfully.
"I'm captain of this ship," said he; "and
Tom&mdash;don't you interfere.  If I've a mind to knock
Mendocino County into the middle of next
week, I'll do it!  But I haven't, and we are
running just right."
</p>

<p>
You see, when he was in this state he was
a very hard man to work with, and if we
differed in our figures I had often enough a big
job to convince him that he was wrong.  And
being wrong even a second in the longitude
means being sixty miles out.  And with only
dead reckoning to rely on, we should have
been feeling our way cautiously toward the
coast, seeing that in any case we might fetch
up on the Farallon Islands, which lie twenty
miles west of the Golden Gate.
</p>

<p>
On the sixth day of this weather it began
to clear up a little in the morning watch, and
there seemed some possibility of our getting
sight of the sun before eight bells.  Will was
on deck, and rather more sober than usual.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir," said I to him, for I was just as
respectful, I'll swear, as if he was no relation,
"there seems a chance of getting an observation;
shall we take it?"
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said he.  "Send Harmer
here, and we'll wait for a chance."
</p>

<p>
Harmer came aft, and brought up Will's
sextant, and just then the port foretopsail
sheet parted, for it was really blowing hard,
though the sun came out at intervals.  I ran
forward myself, and by the time the watch
had clewed up the sail and made it fast, eight
bells had struck.  When I went aft I met Harmer.
</p>

<p>
"Did you get an observation!" I asked
anxiously, for when a man has the woman he
loves on board it makes him feel worried,
especially if things go as they were going
then.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mr. Ticehurst," said he, "and the
captain is working it out now.  But, sir, if I
were you I would go over it after him, for
two heads are better than one," and he
laughed, being a merry, thoughtless
youngster, and went into his berth.
</p>

<p>
However, I did not do what he said, thinking
that we should both get an observation
at noon.  We were very lucky to do so, for
it began to thicken again at ten o'clock, and
we were in a heavy fog until nearly twelve.
And as soon as eight bells was struck, the
fog which had lifted came down again.
</p>

<p>
When I got below Will already had the
chart out, and was showing the women where
we were, as he said; and when I came in he
called me.
</p>

<p>
"There, look, Mr. Chief Officer! what did
I tell you?  Look!" and he pricked off our
position as being just about where he had
reckoned.
</p>

<p>
I took up the slate he had been making
the calculation on, but he saw me, and snatched
it out of my hand.
</p>

<p>
"What d'ye mean?" said he fiercely; "what
do you want?" and he threw it on the deck,
smashing it in four pieces.  I made a sign to
Elsie, and she picked them up like lightning,
while Will called for the steward and some
more brandy, and began drinking in a worse
temper than I had ever seen him in.
</p>

<p>
When I passed Elsie she gave me the
broken bits of slate, and I went into my cabin,
pieced them together, and worked the whole
thing out again.  And when I had done it
the blood ran to my head and I almost fell.
For the morning observation which Will only
had taken was wrongly worked out.  I ran
out on deck like lightning, and found it a
thick fog all round us, for all the wind.  Old
Mackenzie was in the poop, and he roared out
when he saw me:
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter, Tom Ticehurst?"
</p>

<p>
"Put the ship up into the wind, for God's
sake!" I shouted.  "And send a hand up
aloft to look out, for the coast should be
right under our bows.  We must be in
Ballinas Bay."  And as he ported the helm,
I rushed back into the cabin and took the
chart out again to verify our position as near
as I could.  The coast ought to be in sight if
the fog cleared.  For we had run through or
past the Farallones without seeing them.
</p>

<p>
When I came down the women all cried
out at the sight of me, for though I controlled
myself all I could, it was impossible, so
sudden was the shock, to hide all I felt.  And
just then the <i>Vancouver</i> was coming into the
wind, the men were at the lee braces, and as
she dived suddenly into the head seas, her
pitches were tremendous.  It seemed to the
women that something must be wrong,
while Will, who, seaman-like, knew what had
happened, though mad with drink, rushed on
deck with a fierce oath.  I dropped the chart
and ran after him; yet I stayed a moment.
</p>

<p>
"It will be all right," I said to the women;
"but I can't tell you now."  And I followed
Will, who had got hold of old Mackenzie by
the throat, while the poor fellow looked
thunderstruck.
</p>

<p>
"What the devil are you doing?" he
screamed.  "Why don't you keep the course?
Man the weather-braces, you dogs, and put
the helm up!"
</p>

<p>
But no one stirred; while Tom Mackenzie,
seeing me there, took Will by the wrists and
threw him away from him.  I caught him as
he fell, roaring, "Mutiny!  Mutiny!"
</p>

<p>
"It's no mutiny!" I shouted, in my turn;
"if we keep your course we shall be on the
rocks in half an hour.  I tell you the land is
dead to loo-ard, aye, and not five miles off."
</p>

<p>
But it was less than that, for just then it
cleared up a little.  And the lookout on the
foreyard shouted, "Land on the lee-bow!"  Then
he cried out, "Land right ahead!"  Whether
Will heard him or not, I don't
know, but he broke away from me and fell,
rather than went, down the companion, and
in a moment I heard the women scream.
</p>

<p>
I caught Mackenzie by the arm.
</p>

<p>
"It's for our lives, and the lives of the
women?  He's gone for his revolver!  I
shall take command!"
</p>

<p>
And I sprang behind the companion like
lightning.  And just in time, for, as Will
came up, I saw he was armed, and I jumped
right on his back.  His revolver went off and
struck the taffrail; the next moment I had
kicked it forward to where Mackenzie was
standing, and grasped Will by the arms.
</p>

<p>
I had never given him credit for the
strength he showed, but then he was mad,
mad drunk, and it was not till Walker and
Matthias&mdash;for all hands were on deck by this
time&mdash;came to help me that I secured him.
In the struggle Will drew back his foot and
kicked the Malay in the face, and as he rose,
with the evilest look I ever saw on a man's
countenance, he drew his knife instinctively.
With my left hand I caught his wrist and
nearly broke it, while the knife flew out of
his hand.  And then, even by that simple
action, I saw that I had made an enemy of
this man, whom up to this time I had always
been kind to and treated with far more
consideration than he would have got from
rough old Mac.  But this is only by the
way, though it is important enough to the
story.
</p>

<p>
I had to tie Will's hands, and all the time
he foamed at the mouth, ordering the crew to
assist him.
</p>

<p>
"I'll have you hung, you dogs, all of you!"
he shrieked, while the three women stood on
the companion-ladder, white and trembling
with fear.
</p>

<p>
It was with great trouble that we got him
below, and when he was there I shut him in
his berth, and sent the two stewards in with
him to see that he neither did himself harm
nor got free, and then I turned my attention
to saving the ship and our lives.
</p>

<p>
We were in an awfully critical situation,
and one which, in ordinary circumstances,
might have made a man's heart quail; but
now&mdash;with the woman I loved on board&mdash;it
was maddening to think of, and made me
curse my brother who had brought us into it.
Think of what it was.  Not five miles on our
lee-bow there was the land, and we could even
distinguish as we lifted on the sea the cruel
line of white breakers which seemed to run
nearly abeam, for the <i>Vancouver</i> was not a
very weatherly ship, and the gale, instead
of breaking, increased, until, if I had
dared, I would have ordered sail to be
shortened.
</p>

<p>
I went to the chart again.  Just as I took
it, Mackenzie called to me, "Mr. Ticehurst,
there's a big flat-topped mountain some way
inland.  I think it must be Table Mountain."  Yes,
he knew the coast, and even as I looked
at the chart, I heard him order the helm to
be put up.  I saw why, for when we had
hauled into the wind, we were heading dead
for the great four-fathom bank that lies off
Bonita Point.  But there was a channel
between it and the land.
</p>

<p>
I ran on deck and spoke to Mackenzie.  He
pointed out on the starboard hand, and there
the water was breaking on the bank.  We
were running for the narrow channel under a
considerable press of canvas, seeing how it
blew; for all Mac relieved her of when we
first put her into the wind was the main
top-gallant sail.  And now I could do nothing
for a moment but try to get sight of our
landmarks, and keep sight of them, for the
weather was still thick.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, as it might have seemed for
us, the chain-cables had already been ranged
fore and aft on the deck, and I told Mackenzie
to see them bent on to the anchors, and the
stoppers made ready.  Yet I knew that if we
had to anchor, we were lost; in such a gale it
could only postpone our fate, for they would
come home or part to a dead certainty.
</p>

<p>
Mackenzie and I stood together on the
poop watching anxiously for the right moment
to haul our wind again.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think of it, Mr. Mackenzie?"
I said, as I clung on to a weather backstay.
"Where do you think we shall be in half an
hour?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think I shall ever see Whitechapel
again, sir," he answered quietly, and I knew
he was thinking of home, of his wife and his
daughter.  "She will go to leeward like a
butter-cask in this sea; and now look at the
land!"  And he pointed toward the line of
breakers on the land, which came nearer and
nearer.  We waited yet a few minutes, and
then I looked at Mackenzie inquiringly.
"Yes, I think so, sir," he said, and with my
hand I motioned the men at the wheel to put
the helm down again.  As she came into the
wind the upper foretopsail blew out of the
boltropes, while the vessel struggled like a
beaten hound that is being dragged to
execution, and shivered from stem to stern.
For the waves were running what landsmen
call mountains high; she now shipped a sea
every moment, which came in a flood over
the fo'c'sle head; and pouring down through
the scuttle, the cover of which had been
washed overboard, it sent the men's chests
adrift in the fo'c'sle and washed the blankets
out of the lower bunks.  And to windward
the roar of the breakers on the bank was
deafening.  I went below just for a moment.
I knew I had no right to go there, my place
was on deck, but could not help myself.  I
must see Elsie once more before we died, for
if the vessel struck, the first sea that washed
over her might take me with it, and we
should never see each other again on earth.
But the two sisters were not in the saloon.  I
stepped toward their berth, and Helen met
me, rising up from the deck, where she had
been crouching down in terror.
</p>

<p>
I have said she was beautiful; and so she
was when she smiled, and the pleasant light
fell about her like sunlight on some strange
and rare tropical flower, showing her rosy
complexion, her delicate skin of full-blooded
olive, and her coils of dark and shining hair
But I never saw her so beautiful as she was
then, clothed strangely with the fear of death,
white with passion that might have made a
weaker woman crimson with shame, and
fiercely triumphant with a bitter
self-conquest.  She caught me by the arm.  "Tom,
dear Tom," she said, in a wonderful voice
that came to me clearly through the howl of
the wind, "I know there is not hope for us.
He" (and she pointed toward her husband's
cabin) "has ruined us!  I hate him!  And,
Tom, now it is all over, and we shall not
live!  Say good-by to me, say good-by!"
</p>

<p>
I stood thunderstruck and motionless, for
I knew what she meant even before she put
up her hands and took me round the neck.
"Kiss me once, just once, and I will die&mdash;for
now I could not live, and would not!  Kiss
me!"  And I did kiss her.  Why, I know not,
whether out of pity (it was not love&mdash;no,
not love of any kind, I swear) or from the
strong constraint of her force of mind, I
cannot say; and as I lifted my head from hers, I
saw Elsie, the woman I did love, looking at
me with shame at my fall, as she thought,
and with scorn.  I freed myself from Helen,
who sank down on her knees without seeing
that she had been observed, and I went
toward Elsie.  She, too, was pale, though not
with fear, for perhaps she was ignorant of her
danger, but as I thought with a little feeling
of triumph even then, for we are strange
beings, with jealousy and anger.
</p>

<p>
"You are a coward and a traitor!" she
said, when I reached her.
</p>

<p>
"No, no, I am not, Elsie," I answered
sharply; "but perhaps you will never know
that I am speaking the truth.  But let that
be; are you a brave woman?  For&mdash;&mdash;  But
where is your father?"
</p>

<p>
"With Fanny," she answered, disdainfully
even then.
</p>

<p>
I called him, and he came out.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Fleming," I said; "you know our
position; in a few minutes we shall be safe
or&mdash;ashore.  Get your daughters dressed
warmly; stay at the foot of the companion
with them, and, if it is necessary, come up
when I call you."
</p>

<p>
The old man shook hands with me and
pointed to Will's wife.  I had forgotten her!
</p>

<p>
"Look after her, too," I said, and went to
Will's cabin.  He was fast asleep and snoring
hard.  I could hardly keep from striking
him, but I let him lie.  Was it a wonder that
a woman ceased to love him?  And I went
on deck.
</p>

<p>
I had not been absent five minutes, but in
that time the wind had increased even more,
the seas seemed to have grown heavier, the
decks were full of water, and the fatal wake
was yet broader on the weather-quarter.  All
the men were aft under the break of the
poop, and most of them, thinking that we
must go ashore, had taken off their oilskins
and sea-boots ready for an effort to save
themselves at the last.  Even in the state of
mind that I was in then, I saw clearly, and
the strange picture they presented&mdash;wet
through, some with no hats on, up to their
knees in water, for the decks could not clear
themselves, though some of the main deck
ports were stove in and some out in the
bulwarks&mdash;remains vividly with me now.
Among them stood Matthias, with a red
handkerchief over his head, and a swelled
cheek, where Will had struck him.  By his
side was Walker, the only man in the crowd
who seemed cheerful, and he actually smiled.
Perhaps he was what the Scotch called "fey."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Mackenzie called me loudly.
</p>

<p>
"Look sir, look!  There is the point, the
last of the land!  It's Bonita Point, if I
know this coast at all!"
</p>

<p>
I sprang into the weather mizzen rigging,
and the men, who had noticed the second
mate's gestures, did the same at the main.
I could see the Point, and knew it, and I
knew if we could only weather it we could
put the helm up and run into San Francisco
in safety.  Just then Harmer, who was as
cool as a cucumber, struck four bells, and
Matthias and a man called Thompson, an old
one-eyed sailor, came up to relieve the wheel.
</p>

<p>
The point which we had to weather was
about as far from us as the land dead to
leeward, and it was touch and go whether we
should clear it or not.  The <i>Vancouver</i> made
such leeway, closehauled, that it seemed
doubtful, and I fancied we should have a
better chance if I freed her a little, to let her
go through the water faster.  Yet it was a
ticklish point, and one not to be decided
without thought in a situation which
demanded instant action.
</p>

<p>
"What think you, Mac," said I hurriedly;
"shall we ease her half a point?"
</p>

<p>
He nodded, and I spoke to the men at the
wheel, and as I did so I noticed the Malay's
face, which was ghastly with fear, although
he seemed steady enough.  But I thought it
best to alter the way they stood, for the
Englishman had the lee wheel.  I ordered
them to change places.
</p>

<p>
"What's that for, sir?" said Matthias,
almost disrespectfully.  I stared at him.
</p>

<p>
"Do as you are told, you dog!" I
answered roughly, for I had no time to be
polite.  "I don't like your steering.  I have
noticed it before."
</p>

<p>
When the course was altered she got much
more way on her, but neared the land yet
more rapidly.  I called the men on to the
poop, for I had long before this determined
not to chance the anchors, and looked down
into the saloon to see if the women were there.
</p>

<p>
As I did so Mr. Fleming called me.
</p>

<p>
"If I can be of any use, Mr. Ticehurst, I
am ready."
</p>

<p>
"I think not, Mr. Fleming," I replied as
cheerfully as possible; "we shall be out of
danger in a few minutes&mdash;or on the rocks," I
added to myself, as I closed the hatch.
</p>

<p>
It was a breathless and awful time, and I
confess that for a few moments I forgot the
very existence of Elsie, as I calculated over
and over again the chances as we neared the
Point.  It depended on a hair, and when
I looked at Mackenzie, who was silent and
gloomy, I feared the worst.  Yet it shows
how strangely one can be affected by one's
fellows that when I saw Harmer and Walker
standing side by side their almost cheerful
faces made me hope, and I smiled.  But we
were within three cables' length of the Point,
and the roar of the breakers came up against
the wind until it deafened us.  I watched
the men at the wheel, and I saw Matthias
flinch visibly as though he had been struck
by a whip.  I didn't know why it was, I am
not good at such things, but I took a deeper
dislike to him that moment than I had ever
had, and I stepped up to him.  Now in what
followed perhaps I myself was to blame, and
yet I feel I could not have acted differently.
Perhaps I looked threatening at him as I
approached, but at any rate he let go the wheel
and fell back on the gratings.  With an angry
oath I jumped into his place, struck him with
my heel, and then I saw Walker make a
tremendous spring for me, with an expression
of alarm in his face, as he looked beyond me,
that made me make a half turn.  And that
movement saved my life.  I felt the knife of
Matthias enter my shoulder like a red-hot
iron, and then it was wrenched out of his
hand and out of the wound by Walker.
</p>

<p>
In a moment the two were locked together,
and in another they were separated by
Mackenzie and the others; and Walker stood
smiling with the knife in his hand.  Although
the blood was running down my body, I did
not feel faint, and kept my eye fixed on the
course kept by the <i>Vancouver</i>, while Mackenzie
held me in his arms, and Harmer took the
lee wheel from me.
</p>

<p>
"Luff a little!" I cried, for we were almost
on the Point, and I saw a rock nearly dead
ahead.  "Luff a little!" and they put the
helm down on a spoke or two.
</p>

<p>
The moments crawled by, and the coast
crawled nearer and nearer, as I began to feel
I was going blind and fainting.  But I clung
to life and vision desperately, and the last I
saw was what I can see now, and shall always
see as plainly, the high black Point with its
ring of white water crawl aft and yet nearer,
aft to the foremast, aft to the mainmast
and then I fell and knew no more.  For we
were saved.
</p>

<p>
When I came to, we were before the wind,
and I lay on a mattress in the cabin.  Near
me was Elsie, and by her Helen, who was as
white as death.  Both were watching me, and
when I opened my eyes Helen fell on her
knees and suddenly went crimson, and then
white again, and fainted.  But Elsie looked
harder and sterner than I had ever seen her.
I turned my face away, and near me I saw
another mattress with a covered figure on it,
the figure of a dead man, for I knew the shape.
In my state of faintness a strange and horrible
delirium took possession of me.  It seemed
as if what I saw was seen only by myself, and
that it was a prophecy of my death.  I fainted
again.
</p>

<p>
When I came to we were at anchor in San
Francisco Bay, and a doctor from the shore was
attending to me, while Mackenzie stood by,
smiling and rubbing his hands as if delighted
to get me off them.  I looked at him and he
knelt down by me.
</p>

<p>
"Mackenzie, old man," I whispered, "didn't
I see somebody dead here?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye, poor chap," he answered, brushing
away a tear; "it was poor Walker."
</p>

<p>
"Walker!" I said.  "How was that?"
</p>

<p>
"Accident, sir," said old Mac.  "Just as
we rounded the Point and you fainted, the
old bark gave a heavy roll as we put her
before the wind, and Walker, as he was standing
with that black dog's knife in his hand,
slipped and fell.  The blade entered his
body, and all he said after was, 'It was his
knife after all.  He threatened to do for me
yesterday.'"
</p>

<p>
"Where's Will?" I asked, when he ended,
for I was somehow anxious to save my
brother's credit, and I shouldn't have liked
to see him dismissed from the ship.
</p>

<p>
"He's on deck now, as busy as the devil in
a gale of wind," growled Mackenzie.  "'Tis
he that saved the ship.  Oh, he's a mighty
man!&mdash;but I don't sail with him no more."
</p>

<p>
However, he altered his mind about that.
</p>

<p>
Now, it has taken me a long time to get to
this point, and perhaps if I had been a better
navigator in the waters of story-telling I might
have done just what Will didn't do, and have
missed all the trouble of beating to windward
to get round to this part of my story.  I might
have put it all in a few words, perhaps, but
then I like people to understand what I am
about, and it seems to me necessary.  If it
isn't, I dare say someone will tell me one
of these days.  At any rate, here I have got
into San Francisco, a city I don't like by the
way, for it is a rascally place, managed by
the professional politicians, who are the worst
men in it; I had been badly wounded,
and the Malay was in prison, and (not
having money) he was likely to stay there.
</p>

<p>
I was in the hospital for three weeks, and
I never had a more miserable or lonely time.
If I had not been stronger in constitution
than most men I think I should have died, so
much was I worried by my love for Elsie,
who was going away thinking me a scoundrel,
who had tried to gain the love of my
brother's wife.  Of course she did not come
near me, though I knew the Flemings were
still in the city.  I learnt so much from Will,
who had the grace to come and see me,
thanking me, too, for having saved the <i>Vancouver</i>.
</p>

<p>
"You must get well soon, Tom," said he,
"for I need you very much just now."
</p>

<p>
I kept silence, and he looked at me inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
"Will," I said at length, "I shall never I
sail with you again&mdash;I can't do it."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" he cried, in a loud voice,
which made the nurse come up and request
him to speak in a little lower tone.  "Why
not?  I can't see what difference it will make,
anything that has occurred."
</p>

<p>
No, he did not see, but then he did not
know.  How could I go in the ship again
with Helen?  Besides, I had determined to
win Elsie for my wife, and how could I do
that if I let her go now, thinking what she
did of me?
</p>

<p>
"Well, Will, I can't go," said I once more;
"and I don't think I shall go to sea again, I
am sick of it."
</p>

<p>
Will stared, and whistled, and laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Ho!" said he; "I think I see how the
land lies.  You are going to settle in British
Columbia, eh?  You are a sly dog, but I can
see through you.  I know your little love-affair;
Helen told me as much as that one day."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, Will," I answered wearily, for
I was out of heart lying there, "if you know,
you can understand now why I am not going
to sail with you.  But, Will," and I rose on
my elbow, hurting myself considerably as I
did so, "let me implore you not to drink in
future.  Have done with it.  It will be your
ruin and your wife's&mdash;aye, and if I sailed
with you, mine as well.  Give me your hand,
and say you will be a sober man for the
future, and then I shall be content to go
where I must go&mdash;aye, and where I will go."
</p>

<p>
He gave me his hand, that was hot with
what he had been drinking even then (it was
eleven in the morning), and I saw tears in his
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I will try, Tom," he muttered; "but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I think that "but" was the saddest word,
and the most prophetic, I ever heard on any
man's lips.  I saw how vain it was, and turned
away.  He shook hands, and went without
saying more than "Good-by, Tom."  I saw
him twice after that, and just twice.
</p>

<p>
By the time I was out of the hospital the
<i>Vancouver</i> was ready to go to sea, being
bound to England; and she might have
sailed even then, only it was necessary for
Tom Mackenzie and one or two others to
remain as witnesses when they tried Matthias
for stabbing me.  I shall not go into a long
description of the trial, for I have read in
books of late so many trial scenes that I fear
I should not have the patience to give details,
which, after all, are not necessary, since the
whole affair was so simple.  And yet, what
followed afterward from that affair I can
remember as brightly and distinctly as if in
a glass&mdash;the look of the dingy court, the
fierce and revengeful eyes of Matthias, who
never spoke till the last, and the appearance
of Helen and Fanny (Elsie was not
there)&mdash;when the judge after the verdict inflicted a
sentence of eighteen months' hard labor on
the prisoner.  Perhaps he had been in prison
before, and knew what it meant, or it was
simply the bitter thought of a revengeful
Oriental at being worsted by his opponent;
but when he heard the sentence, he leant
forward and grasped the rail in front of him
tightly, and spoke.  His skin was dark and
yet pallid, the perspiration stood in beads on
his forehead, he bit his lips until blood came,
while his eyes looked more like the eyes of a
human beast than those of a man.  This is
what he said as he looked at me, and he
spoke with a strange intensity which hushed
all noise.
</p>

<p>
"When I come out of jail I will track you
night and day, wherever you go or whatever
you do to escape me.  Though you think I
do not know where you are, I shall always
be seeking for you, and at last I shall find
you.  If a curse of mine could touch you,
you should rot and wither now, but the time
will come when my hand shall strike you down!"
</p>

<p>
Such was the meaning of what he said,
although it was not put exactly as I have
here written it down; and if I confess, as I
should have to do at last before the end of
this story comes, that the words and the way
they were spoken&mdash;spoken so vehemently
and with so fixed a resolution&mdash;made me
shiver and feel afraid in a way I had never
done before, I hope nobody will blame me;
but I am sure that being in love makes a
coward of a man in many ways, and in one
moment I saw myself robbed of life and love
just at their fruition.  I beheld myself
clasping Elsie to my bosom, having won from her
at last an avowal of her love, and then
stabbed or shot in her arms.  Ah! it was
dreadful the number of fashions my mind
went to work, in a quick fever of black
apprehension, to foretell or foresee my own
possible doom.  I had never thought myself
cowardly, but then I seemed to see what
death meant better than I had ever done;
and often the coward is what he is, as I think
now, from a vivid imagination, which so
many of us lack.  I went out of the court in
a strange whirl, for you see I had only just
recovered.  If I had been quite well I might
have laughed instead of feeling as I did.
But I did not laugh then.
</p>

<p>
Now, on the next morning the <i>Vancouver</i>
was to leave the harbor, being then at anchor
off Goat Island.  All the money that was
due to me I had taken, for Will had given
me my discharge, and I sent home for what I
had saved, being quite uncertain what I
should do if I followed Elsie to British
Columbia.  And that night I saw the last of
Will, the last I ever saw, little thinking then
how his fate and mine were bound up
together, nor what it was to be.  Helen was
with him, and I think if he had been sober
or even gentle with her in his drink, she
would have never spoken to me again as she
did on that day when she believed that life
was nearly at its end for both of us.  But
Will, having finished all his business, had
begun to drink again, and was in a vile
temper as we sat in a room at the American
Exchange Hotel, where I was staying.
Helen tried to prevent his drinking.
</p>

<p>
"Will," she said, in rather a hard voice
from the constraint she put on herself, "you
have had enough of drink, we had better go
on board."
</p>

<p>
"Go on board yourself," said he, "and
don't jaw me!  I wish I had left you in
Australia.  A woman on board a ship is like
a piano in the fo'c'sle.  Come and have a
drink, Tom."
</p>

<p>
"No, thank you," I said; "I have had
quite enough."
</p>

<p>
And out he went, standing drinks at the
bar to half a dozen, some of whom would
have cut his throat for a dollar, I dare say, by
the looks of them.  Then Helen came over
and sat down by me.
</p>

<p>
"I have never spoken to you, Tom," she
began, and then she stopped, "since&mdash;you
know, since that dreadful day outside there,"
and she pointed, just like a woman who
never knows the bearings of a place until she
has reckoned out how the house points first,
to the East when she meant the West, "and
now I feel I must, because I may never have
the chance again."
</p>

<p>
She took out her handkerchief, although
she was dry-eyed, and twisted it into a
regular ground-swell knot, until I saw the stuff
give way here and there.  She seemed
unable to go on, and perhaps she would not
have said more if we hadn't heard Will's
voice, thick with drink, as he demanded more
liquor.
</p>

<p>
"Hear him!" she said hurriedly, "hear
the man who is my husband!  What a fool I
was!  You don't know, but I was.  And I
am his wife!  Ah!  I could kill him!  I
could!  I could!"
</p>

<p>
I was horrified to see the passion she was
in; it seemed to have a touch of real male
fury in it, just as when a man is trying to
control himself, feeling that if one more
provocation is given him he will commit murder,
for she shook and shivered, and her voice
was strangely altered.
</p>

<p>
And just then Will came back, demanding
with an oath if she was ready to go.
She never spoke, but I should have been
sorry to have any woman look at me as she
did at him when his eyes were off her.  I
shook hands with her and with him, for the
last time, and they went away.
</p>

<p>
Next morning, being lonely and having
nothing to do I went out to the park, made
on the great sand-dunes which runs from the
higher city to the ocean beach and the Cliff
House on the south side of the Golden Gate.
For the sake of a quiet think I went out by
the cars, and walked to a place where few
ever came but chance visitors, except on
Sunday.  It is just at the bend of the great
drive and a little above the road, where
there is a large tank with a wooden top,
which makes a good seat from which one
can see back to San Francisco and across the
bay to Oakland, Saucelito, and the other
little watering-places in the bay; or before
one, toward the opening of the Golden
Gate, and the guns of Alcatraz Island, where
the military prison is.  Here I took my seat
and looked out on the quiet beautiful bay
and the sea just breaking in a line of foam
on the beach beneath me.  The sight of the
ships at anchor was rather melancholy to me,
for my life had been on the sea.  It seemed
as if a new and unknown life were before
me; and a sailor starting anything ashore is
as strange as though some inveterate dweller
in a city should go to sea.  There were one
or two white sails outside the Heads, and
one vessel was being towed in; there was a
broad wake from the Saucelito ferry-boat,
and far out to sea I saw the low Farallones
lying like a cloud on the horizon.  It was
beyond them that my new life had begun,
really begun; and though the day was fair,
I knew not how soon foul weather might
overtake me, and I knew indeed that it could
only be postponed unless fate were very
kind.  I don't know how long I sat on that
tank drumming on the hollow wood, as I idly
picked up the pebbles from the ground and
threw them down into the road; but at last
I saw what I had partly been waiting
for&mdash;the <i>Vancouver</i> being towed out to sea.  I
had no need to look at her twice; I knew
every rope in her, and every patch of paint,
to say nothing of her masts being ranked a
little more than is usual nowadays.  I had
no glass with me, but I fancied I could see a
patch of color on her poop that was Helen.
</p>

<p>
I watched the vessel which had been my
home&mdash;and which, but for me, would have
been lying a wreck over yonder&mdash;for more
than an hour, and then I turned to go home,
if I can call an American hotel "home" by
strained politeness, and just then I saw a
carriage come along.  Now, I knew as well
before I could distinguish them that Elsie,
Fanny, and her father were in that carriage,
as I did that Helen was on board the
<i>Vancouver</i>; and I sat down again feeling
very faint&mdash;I suppose from the effects of
my wound, or the illness that came from it.
The carriage had almost passed beneath me&mdash;and
I felt Elsie saw me, though she made
no sign&mdash;before Mr. Fleming caught sight of me.
</p>

<p>
"Hi! stop!" he called, and the driver
drew up.  "Why, Mr. Ticehurst, is that
you?  I thought the <i>Vancouver</i> had gone?
Besides, how does a mate find time to be
out here?  Things must have changed
since I was at sea.  Come down!  Come down!"
</p>

<p>
I did so, and shook hands with them all,
though Elsie's hand lay in mine like a dead
thing until she drew it away.
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Vancouver</i> has gone, Mr. Fleming,"
said I; "and there she is&mdash;look!"
</p>

<p>
They all turned, and Elsie kept her eyes
fixed on it when the others looked at me again.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Fleming, "what does it all
mean?  Where are you going?  Back to
town?  That's right, get in!"  And without
more ado the old man, who had the grip of
a vise, caught hold of me, and in I came like
a bale of cotton.  "Drive on!"
</p>

<p>
"Now then," he went on, "you can tell us
why you didn't go with them."
</p>

<p>
I paused a minute, watching Elsie.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mr. Fleming," I said at last, "you
see I didn't quite agree with my brother."
</p>

<p>
"H'm!&mdash;calls taking the command from
the captain not quite agreeing with him,"
chuckled Fleming; "but I thought you made
it up, didn't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we made it up, but I wouldn't sail
with him any more.  I had more than one reason."
</p>

<p>
Again I looked at Elsie, and she was, I
thought, a little pleasanter, though she did
not speak.  But Fanny pinched her arm, I
could see that, and looked roguishly at me.
However, Mr. Fleming, did not notice that byplay.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said, a trifle drily as I fancied,
"I won't put you through your catechism,
except to ask you in a fatherly kind of way"
(Elsie looked down and frowned) "what you
are going to do now.  I should have thought
after what that rascal of a half-bred Malay,
or whatever he is, said, that you would have
left California in a hurry."
</p>

<p>
"Time enough, Mr. Fleming&mdash;time enough.
I have eighteen months to look out on
without fear of a knife in my ribs, and I may be
in China, or Alaska, or the Rocky Mountains
then."
</p>

<p>
You see I wanted to give them a hint that
I might turn up in British Columbia.  Fanny
gave me a better chance though, and I could
have hugged her for it.
</p>

<p>
"Or British Columbia perhaps, Mr. Ticehurst?"
she said smiling very innocently.
</p>

<p>
"Who knows," I answered, hastily; "when
a man begins to travel, there is no knowing
where he may turn up.  I had a fancy to go
to Alaska, though."
</p>

<p>
For the way to Alaska was the way to
British Columbia, and I did not want to
surprise them too much if I went on the same
steamer as far as Victoria.  And in four
days I might see what chance I really had
with Elsie.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said the father, thoughtfully, "I
don't know, and can't give advice.  I should
have thought that when a man was a good
sailor and held your position he ought to stick
to it.  A rolling stone gathers no moss."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," I answered, "but I am tired of the sea."
</p>

<p>
"So am I," said Fanny, "and I don't
blame you, though you ought to go with
careless captains just on purpose to save
people's lives, you know, Mr. Ticehurst; for
you saved ours, and I think some of us
might thank you better than by sitting like a
dry stick without saying a word."
</p>

<p>
With this she dug at Elsie with her elbow,
smiling sweetly all the time.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Elsie, "and there is Mr. Harmer
now in the <i>Vancouver</i>.  Perhaps
she will be wrecked."
</p>

<p>
This was the first word she had spoken
since I had entered the carriage, and I
recognized by its spite that Elsie was a
woman not above having a little revenge.
For poor Fanny, who had flirted quite a
little with Harmer, said no more.
</p>

<p>
They put down at their hotel, and I went
inside with them.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Fleming, "I suppose we
shan't see you again, unless you do as Fanny
says, and turn up in our new country.  If
you do, be sure we shall welcome you.  And
I wish you well, my boy."
</p>

<p>
I shook hands with them again, and
turned away; and as I did so, I noticed
some of their boxes marked, "Per
SS. <i>Mexico</i>."  Fanny saw me looking, and
whispered quickly, as she passed me, "Tom
Ticehurst, go to Mexico!" and vanished,
while Elsie stood in the gaslight for a
moment as if in indecision.  But she turned
away.

<h3>
PART II.
<br /><br />
SAN FRANCISCO AND NORTHWARD.
</h3>

<p>
I never felt so miserable and so inclined
to go to sea to forget myself in hard work
as I did that evening after I had bidden
farewell to Elsie and her people.  It seemed
to me that she had let me go too easily
out of her life for her to really care for me
enough to make her influence my course in
the way I had hoped, and hoped still.
Indeed, I think that if she had not stayed
that one undecided moment after she
withdrew her hand from mine, I should have
never done what I did do, but have looked
for a ship at once.  For, after all, I said to
myself, what could a modest girl do more?
Why, under the circumstances, when she
thought me guilty of a deliberate crime,
hateful to any woman, to say nothing of my
having made love to her at the same time, it
was really more than I could have expected
or hoped.  It showed that I had a hold upon
her affections; and then Fanny thought so
too, or she would have never said what she
did.  "Go to Mexico!" indeed; if I wasn't
a fool, it was not Mexico the country, but
<i>Mexico</i> the steamer she meant.  I had one
ally, at any rate.  Still, I wondered if she
knew what Elsie did, though I thought not,
for she alone kissed Helen when they said
good-by, and Elsie had only given her her
hand unwillingly.  If I could speak to
Fanny it might help me.  But I was
determined to go northward, and sent my
dunnage down on board the steamer that
very evening.
</p>

<p>
In the morning, and early, for I lay awake
all that night, a thing I did not remember
having done before, I went down on the
Front at the bottom of Market Street, where
all the tram cars start, and walked to and fro
for some hours along the wharves where they
discharge lumber, or ship the coal.  It was
quite a bright morning in the late autumn,
and everything was pleasant to look upon in
the pure air before it was fouled by the oaths
of the drivers of wagons and the jar of traffic.
Yet that same noise, which came dimly to me
until I was almost run over by a loaded
wagon, pleased me a great deal better than
the earlier quiet of the morning, and by eight
o'clock I was in a healthy frame of mind,
healthy enough to help three men with a
heavy piece of lumber just by way of
exercise.  I went back to my room, washed my
hands, had breakfast, and went on board the
steamer, careless if the Flemings saw me,
though at first I had determined to keep out
of their way until the vessel was at sea.  I
thanked my stars that I did so, for I saw
Fanny by herself on deck, and when she
caught sight of me she clapped her hands and
smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Well, and where are you going, Mr. Ticehurst?"
said she, nodding at me as if she
guessed my secret.
</p>

<p>
"I am going to take your advice and go to
Mexico!" I answered.
</p>

<p>
"Is it far here?  By land do you go, or water?"
</p>

<p>
"Not far, Fanny; in fact&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You are&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There now!" said I, laughing in my turn.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I am so glad, Mr. Ticehurst!" said
she; "for&mdash;&mdash;" and then she stopped.
</p>

<p>
"For what, Fanny?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I can't tell you.  I should be a
traitor, and that is cowardly."
</p>

<p>
"No, Fanny, not when we are friends.  If
you tell me, would you do any harm?"
</p>

<p>
"No," she answered doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Then treachery is meant to do harm, and
if you don't mean harm it isn't treachery," I
replied coaxingly, but with bad logic as I have
been told since.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, perhaps I'll say something.
Now suppose you liked me very much&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"So I do, Fanny, I swear!"
</p>

<p>
"No you don't, stupid!  How can you?
I'm not twins&mdash;that is, I and somebody else
aren't the same&mdash;so don't interrupt.
Suppose you liked me very much, and I liked
you very much&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It would be very nice, I dare say," I said,
in a doubtful way that was neither diplomatic
nor complimentary.
</p>

<p>
"And suppose you went off, and suppose I
didn't speak to my sister for hours, and kept
on being a nasty thing by tossing and tumbling
about all night, so that she, poor girl,
couldn't go to sleep; and then suppose when
she did go off nicely, she woke up to find
me&mdash;what do you think&mdash;crying, what would it mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Fanny," I exclaimed, in delight, "you
are a dear girl, the very dearest&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No," she said, "no!"
</p>

<p>
"That I ever saw.  If there weren't so
many folks about, I would kiss you!"
</p>

<p>
And I meant it, but Fanny burst into
laughter.
</p>

<p>
"The idea!  I should like to see you try it.
I would box your ears till they were as red
as beetroot.  But there, Tom, I am glad you
are coming on this dirty steamer.  For I
have no one to talk to now but Elsie, and
she won't talk at all."
</p>

<p>
However, Fanny's little woes did not
trouble me much, for I was thinking of my
own, and wondering how I ought to act.
</p>

<p>
"Fanny," said I, "tell me what I shall do.
Shall I lie low and not show up until we are
out at sea, or what?"
</p>

<p>
"If you don't want them to see you, you
had better look sharp, for they are coming
up now, I see Elsie's hat," said Fanny.  And
I dived out of sight round the deck house,
and by dint of skillful navigation I got into
my bunk without any one seeing me.
</p>

<p>
Now, the way Elsie found out I was on
board was very curious, and perhaps more
pleasing to Fanny than to her.  My bunk
was an upper one, and through the open
porthole I could look out on to the wharf.  As I
lay there, in a much happier frame of mind
than I had known for many days, I stared
out carelessly, watching the men at work,
and the passers-by; and suddenly to my
great astonishment, I saw young Harmer
looking very miserable and unhappy.  He
had left the <i>Vancouver</i>, too, but of course
without leave, as he was an apprentice.  Now,
if I was surprised I was angry, too.  It was
such a foolish trick, and I thought I would
give him a talking to at once.  I spoke
through the port.
</p>

<p>
"You infernal young fool!" said I, "what
are you doing here?  Why did you leave
your ship?"
</p>

<p>
If ever I saw a bewildered face it was
Harmer's.  For some seconds he looked
everywhere for the voice, and could not locate it
either on the wharf, deck, or anywhere else.
</p>

<p>
"You ought to be rope's-ended for an
idiot!" I went on, and then he saw part
of my face, but without knowing who I was.
He flushed crimson, and looked like a young
turkeycock, with his wings down and his tail up.
</p>

<p>
"Who the devil are you, anyhow," he
asked fiercely.  "You come out here and I'll
pull your ugly head off!"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," I answered calmly, "my
head is of more use to me than yours is,
apparently; and if you don't know my voice,
it belongs to Tom Ticehurst!"
</p>

<p>
Harmer jumped.
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!  Oh, I'm so glad.  I was looking
for you, Mr. Ticehurst, and hunting everywhere."
</p>

<p>
"And not for anyone else, I suppose?" I
put in, and then I saw him look up.  I knew
just as well as he did that he saw Fanny, and
I hoped that Elsie was not with her.  But
she was.
</p>

<p>
"How d'ye do, Miss Fleming?" said he
nervously; "and you, Miss Fanny?  I hope
you are well.  I was just talking to Mr. Ticehurst."
</p>

<p>
I swore a little at this, and tumbled out of
my bunk, and went on deck to face the music,
as the Americans say, and I got behind the
girls in time to hear the little hypocrite Fanny
say sweetly:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Harmer, you must be mistaken,
I'm sure!  Mr. Ticehurst if going to Mexico
or somewhere.  He can't be here."
</p>

<p>
"Miss Fanny," said the boy earnestly,
"I tell you he is, and there&mdash;just behind
you.  By Jove, I am coming on board!"
</p>

<p>
And he scrambled up the side like a
monkey, as Elsie turned and saw me.
</p>

<p>
I said good-morning to her and we shook
hands.  I could see she was nervous, and
fancied I could see traces of what Fanny,
who talked hard, had told me.
</p>

<p>
"Dear me, Mr. Ticehurst!" said Fanny
vigorously.  "You didn't shake hands with
me, and see the time it is since we last met!
Why, was it yesterday, or when?  But men
are so forgetful.  I never did like boys
when I was a little girl, and I shall keep
it up.  Yes, Mr. Harmer, now I can shake
hands, for not having arms ten feet long I
couldn't reach yours over the rail, though
you did hold them out like a signal post."
</p>

<p>
Then she and Harmer talked, and I lost
what they said.
</p>

<p>
"Where is your father, Miss Fleming?"
I asked, for though I felt obliged to talk,
I could say nothing but that unless I
remarked it was a fine day.  But it had been
fine for six months in California.
</p>

<p>
"He went ashore, Mr. Ticehurst, and won't
be back until the steamer is nearly ready to
go.  But now I must go down.  Come,
Fanny!"
</p>

<p>
"What for?" demanded that young lady.
"I'm not coming, I shall stay; I like the
deck, and hate the cabin&mdash;misty stuffy hole!
I shall not go down; as the pilot told the
man in the stupid song: 'I shall pace the
deck with thee,' Mr. Ticehurst, please."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Fanny," said I; "but I
want to talk to Harmer here before the
steamer goes, and if you will go with your
sister perhaps it will be best."
</p>

<p>
She pouted and looked about her, and
with a parting smile for Harmer, and a
mouth for me, she followed Elsie.  I turned
to the lad.
</p>

<p>
"Now," I began, "you're a nice boy!
What does it all mean?"
</p>

<p>
"It means that I couldn't stay on the
<i>Vancouver</i> if you weren't there, Mr. Ticehurst.
I made up my mind to that the moment
I heard you were leaving.  I will go
on your next ship; but you know, if you
don't mind my saying it, I couldn't stand
your brother; I would rather be struck by you
than called a cub by him.  A 'cub,' indeed&mdash;I
am as big as he is, and bigger!"
</p>

<p>
So he was, and a fine handsome lad into
the bargain, with curly brown hair, though
his features were a little too feminine for his
size and strength.
</p>

<p>
"Harmer," I said drily "I think you have
done it now very completely.  This is my
next ship, and I am a passenger in her."
</p>

<p>
He didn't seem to mind; in fact, he took it
so coolly that I began to think he knew.
</p>

<p>
"That doesn't matter, Mr. Ticehurst," he
said cheerfully; "I will come with you."
</p>

<p>
I stared.
</p>

<p>
"The devil you will!  Do you know
where I am going, what I am going to do?&mdash;or
have you any plans of your own cut and
dried for me?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't see that it matters, Mr. Ticehurst,"
he answered, with a coolness I
admired; "I have more than enough to pay
my fare, and if you go to British Columbia
I dare say I can get something to do there."
</p>

<p>
"Ah?  I see," I replied; "you are tired of
the sea, and would like to marry and settle
down, eh?"
</p>

<p>
He looked at me, and blushed a little.
</p>

<p>
"All the more reason I should go with
you, sir; for then&mdash;then&mdash;there would be&mdash;you know."
</p>

<p>
"What, Harmer?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"A pair of us," he answered humbly.
</p>

<p>
"H'm, you are a nice boy?  What will
your father say if he hears you have gone off
in this way?"
</p>

<p>
Harmer looked at me and laughed.
</p>

<p>
"He will say it was your fault, sir!
But I had better get my dunnage on board."
</p>

<p>
And away he went.
</p>

<p>
"Harmer, come back!" I cried, but he
only turned, nodded cheerfully, and
disappeared in the crowd.
</p>

<p>
On the whole, although the appearance of
Harmer added a new responsibility to those
which were already a sufficient burden, I
was not ill-pleased, for I thoroughly liked
him, and had parted with him very unwillingly
when I shook his hand on board the
<i>Vancouver</i> for the last time, as I thought
then.  At any rate, he would be a companion
for me, and if by having to look after him I
was prevented in any measure from becoming
selfish about Elsie, I might thank his boyish
foolishness in being unable to prevent
himself running after Fanny, whom, to say the
truth, I considered a little flirt, though a dear
little girl.  And, then, Harmer might be able
to help me with Elsie.  It was something to
have somebody about that I could trust in
case of accident.
</p>

<p>
It was nearer eleven than ten when the
steamer's whistle shrieked for the last time,
and the crew began to haul the warps on
board.  I could see that Elsie and Fanny
were beginning to think that their father
would arrive too late, when I saw him coming
along the wharf with Harmer just behind
him.  Up to this time I really believed
Mr. Fleming, with the curious innocence that
fathers often show, even those who from their
antecedents and character might be expected
to know better, had never thought of me as
being his daughter's lover; but when he had
joined his daughters on the hurricane deck,
and caught sight of Harmer and myself
standing on the main, I saw in a  moment
that he knew almost as much as we could tell
him, and that for a few seconds he was doubtful
whether to laugh or to be angry.  I saw
him look at me sternly for a few seconds,
then he shook his head with a very
mixed smile on his weather-beaten face, and,
sitting down on the nearest beach, he burst
into laughter.  I went up the poop ladder
and caught Fanny's words:
</p>

<p>
"Why, father, what is the matter with
you?  Don't laugh so, all the people will
think you crazy?"
</p>

<p>
"So I am, my dear, clean crazy," he
answered; "because I fancied I saw Tom
Ticehurst and young Harmer down on deck there,
and of course it is impossible, I know that&mdash;quite
impossible.  It was an hallucination.
For what could they want here, I should like
to know?  You don't know, of course?
Well, well, I am surprised!"
</p>

<p>
Just then I came up and showed myself,
looking quite easy, though I confess to
feeling more like a fool than I remember doing
since I was a boy.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, then you are here, Ticehurst?" said
the old man.  "It wasn't a vision, after all.
I was just telling Fanny here that I thought
I was going off my head."
</p>

<p>
I laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Mr. Fleming," I said, "is it
impossible that I, too, should go to Victoria, on
my way to Alaska?"
</p>

<p>
Fleming looked at me curiously, and almost
winked.  "Ah!  Alaska, to be sure,"
said he.  "You did speak of Alaska.  It
must be a nice place.  You will be quite
close to us.  Come over and give us a call."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you for the invitation," I replied,
laughing.  "I will come to tea, and bring my
young friend with me."
</p>

<p>
For Harmer now walked up, shook hands
with the old man in the most ordinary way,
and sat down between him and Fanny with
a coolness I could not have imitated for my
life.  It is a strange thing to think of the
amount of impudence boys have from
seventeen to twenty-three or so; they will do
things a man of thirty would almost faint to
attempt, and succeed because they don't
know the risk they run.  Harmer was soon
engaged in talk with Fanny, and I tried in
vain to imitate him.  I found Elsie as cold
as ice; I could make no impression on her
and was almost in despair at the very outset.
If Fanny had told me the truth in the
morning, then Elsie held a great command over
herself.  I soon gave up the attack and
retreated to my berth, where I smoked
savagely and was miserable.  You can see I did
not understand much about women then.
</p>

<p>
The passage from San Francisco to Victoria
takes about four days, and in that time
I had to make up my mind what I was
going to do.  If what Fanny said were true,
Elsie loved me, and it was only that foolish
and wretched affair with Helen that stood in
my way.  Yet, could I tell the girl how
matters were?  It seemed to me then, and
seems to me now, that I was bound in honor
not to tell her.  I could not say to her
brutally that my brother's wife had made love to
me, and that I was wholly blameless.  It
would be cowardly, and yet I ought to clear
myself.  It was an awkward dilemma.
Then, again, it was quite possible that Fanny
was mistaken; if she did not care for me, it
was all the harder, and I could not court her
with that mark against me.  Yet I was
determined to win her, and as I sat in my
berth I grew fierce and savage in my heart.
I swore that I would gain her over, I would
force her to love me, if I had to kill any who
stood in my way.  For love makes a man
devilish sometimes as well as good.  I had
come on board saying, "If I see no chance
to win her before I get to Victoria, I will
let her go."  And now when we were just
outside the Golden Gate, I swore to follow her
always.  "Yes, even if she spurns me, if
she mocks, taunts me, I will make her
come to me at last, put her arms round my
neck, and ask my forgiveness."  I said this,
and unconsciously I added, "I will follow
her night and day, in sunshine and in rain, in
health or sickness."
</p>

<p>
Then I started violently, for I was using
words like those of the Malay, who was
waiting his time to follow me, and for ever
in the daytime or nighttime I knew he was
whetting the keen edge of his hate.  I could
see him in his cell; I could imagine him
recalling my face to mind, for I knew what
such men are.  I had served as second mate
in a vessel that had been manned with
Orientals and the off-scourings of Singapore,
such as Matthias was, and I knew them only
too well.  He would follow me, even as I
followed her, and as she was a light before
me, he would be a dark shadow behind me.
I wished then that I had killed him on board
the <i>Vancouver</i>, for I felt that we should one
day meet; and who could discern what our
meeting would bring forth in our lives?  I
know that from that time forward he never
left me, for in the hour that I vowed to
follow Elsie until she loved me, I saw very
clearly that he would keep his word, though
he had but strength to crawl after me and
kill me as I slept.  Henceforth, he was
always more or less in my mind.  Yet, if I
could win Elsie first, I did not care.  It
might be a race between us, and her love
might be a shield to protect me in my hour
of need.  I prayed that it might be so,
and if it could not, then at least let me
win her love before the end.
</p>

<p>
For two days I kept out of the Flemings'
way, or rather out of the way of the girls,
for Mr. Fleming himself could not be
avoided, as he slept in the men's berth in a
bunk close to mine.  I believe that the first
day on board he spoke to Elsie about me;
indeed I know he did, for I heard so
afterward; and I think it was only on her
assurance that there was and could be
nothing between us, that he endured the
situation so easily.  In the first place,
although he was not rich, he was fairly
well off in Australia; and though the
British Columbian ranch property was
not equal in value to that which he had
made for himself, yet it represented a sum
of money such as I could not scarcely make
in many years in these hard times.  It would
hardly be human nature for a father to look
upon me as the right sort of man for his
daughter, especially since I was such a fool
as to quit the sea without anything definite
awaiting me on land.  So, I say, that if he
had thought that Elsie loved me I might
have found him a disagreeable companion,
and it was no consolation to me to see that
he treated me in a sort of half-contemptuous,
half-pitying way, for I would rather have
seen him like one of the lizards on the
Australian plains, such as the girls had
told me of, which erect a spiny frill over
their heads, and swell themselves out the
whole length of their body until their
natural ugliness becomes a very horror and
scares anything which has the curiosity
or rashness to approach and threaten them.
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do in Alaska or
British Columbia, Tom?" said he to me one
day.  "Do you think of farming, or
seal-hunting, or gold-mining, or what?  I
should like to hear your plans, if you have
any."  And then he went on without waiting
for an answer, showing plainly that he
thought that I had none, and was a fool.
"And that young idiot Harmer, why
didn't he stick to his ship?"
</p>

<p>
"Because he will never stick to anything,
Mr. Fleming," I answered, "though he is a
clever young fellow, and fit for other things
than sailoring, if I'm a judge.  But as for
myself I don't think I am, and yet when I
make up my mind to a thing, I usually do it."
</p>

<p>
"You usually succeed, then?" said he,
with a hard smile.  "It is well to have
belief in one's own strength and abilities.
But sometimes others have strength as well,
and then"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"And then," I answered, "it is very often
a question of will."
</p>

<p>
He smiled again and dropped the subject.
</p>

<p>
On the third day out from San Francisco,
when we were running along the coast of
Oregon, I found at last an opportunity of
speaking to Elsie.  I first went to Fanny.
</p>

<p>
"Fanny, my dear girl, I want to speak
to you a few minutes."  I sat down beside her.
</p>

<p>
"I think you know, Fanny, why I am
here, don't you?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"It is tolerably obvious, Mr. Ticehurst,"
she answered rather gravely, I thought.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I suppose it is; but first I want
to be sure whether you were right about
what you told me on the morning we left
San Francisco."
</p>

<p>
I was silent, and looked at her.  She
seemed a trifle distressed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Tom, I thought that I was," she
answered at length; "and I still think I
am&mdash;and yet I don't know.  You see, Elsie is a
strange girl, and never confides in anyone
since dear mother died, and she would never
confess anything to me.  Still, I have eyes
in my head, and ears too.  But since you
have been with us she has been harder and
colder than I ever saw her in all my life, and
she has said enough to make me think that
there is something that I know nothing about
which makes her so.  You know, I joked her
about you yesterday, and she got so angry
all of a sudden, like pouring kerosene on a
fire, and she said you were a coward.  When
I asked her why, she turned white and
wouldn't answer.  Then I said of course you
must be a coward if she said so, but I didn't
think she had any right to say it or think it
when you had saved all our lives by your
coolness and courage.  And then, you know,
I got angry and cried, because I like you
very much, just as much as I do my brother
on the station at home.  And I said she was
a cruel beast, and all kinds of horrid things,
until I couldn't think of anything but making
faces at her, just as I did when I was a child.
And we are having a quarrel now, and it is
all about you&mdash;you ought to be proud."  And
Fanny looked up half laughing and half
crying, for she dearly loved Elsie, as I knew.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my dear little sister Fanny," I said,
"for you shall be my sister one day, there is
something that makes her think ill of me,
but it is not my fault, as far as I can see.
And I can't convince her of that, except by
showing her that I am not the man she
thinks, unless some accident puts me back
into the place I once believed I held in her
thoughts.  But I want to speak to her, and I
must do it to-day.  To-morrow we shall be
in Victoria, and I should not like to part
with her without speaking.  If I talk with
her now, it will probably take some time, so
I want you, if you can, to prevent anyone
interrupting us."
</p>

<p>
Fanny nodded, and wiped away a tear
in a quick manner, just as if it were a fly.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, I will.  You know I trust
you, if Elsie doesn't."  And she went over
to Harmer, who was in a fidget, and kept
looking at me as if he was wondering what I
meant by talking so confidentially to Fanny.
</p>

<p>
I found Elsie sitting by herself just
forward of the funnel.  She was reading, and
though when I spoke she answered and put
the book down in her lap, she kept looking
at it in a nervous way, as if she wished I had
not interrupted her; and we had been talking
some minutes before she seemed to wholly
forget that it was there.
</p>

<p>
I spoke without any thought of what I
was going to say.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Fleming (see, I call you that, though
a little while ago it was Elsie), I have
determined to speak to you in spite of the way
you avoid me."
</p>

<p>
"I would rather you did not, Mr. Ticehurst,"
she said.
</p>

<p>
"It has come to a time when I must do as
I think fit, even if I am rude and rough.  I
have something to say, and mean to say it,
Miss Fleming; and if I word it in rough or
broken fashion, if I stumble over it or
stammer with my tongue, you will know why,
just as you know why I am here.  Come
now, why am I on this steamer?"
</p>

<p>
She remained mute, with her head bent
down, and the gold of her hair loose over her
eyes, so that I could not see them.  But she
trembled a little, and was ripping one of the
pages of her book.  I took hold of it and put
it down.  She made no remonstrance, and I
began to feel that I had power over her,
though how far it went I could not tell.
</p>

<p>
"Why am I here?" I went on scornfully.
"Oh, on a pleasure trip to see the advertised
coast from San Francisco to Sitka, to behold
Mount Elias and its glaciers!  By Heavens,
I think I have ice nearer at hand!  Oh, it is
business?  I wish to gain wealth, so I give
up what I understand, and go into what is as
familiar to me as a sextant is to a savage!
It can't be business.  Do you know what it
is, Miss Fleming?  Look, I think there was
a girl who I knew once, but she was a kind,
bright girl, who was joyous, whom I called
by her Christian name, who walked by my
side in the moonlight, when the sails were
silvered and their shadows dark, when I kept
the first watch in the <i>Vancouver</i>.  I wonder
what has become of her?  That girl would
have known, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I stopped, and she was still stubborn.
But she did not move.  I went on again:
</p>

<p>
"There must be evil spirits on the sea that
fly like petrels in the storm, and come on
board ship and enter into the hearts of those
they find there.  Why&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I fear, Mr. Ticehurst," she interrupted,
"that you think me a fool.  If I am not,
then your talk is vain; and if I am, I surely
am not fit to mate with you.  Let us cease to
talk about this, for it is useless!"
</p>

<p>
I was almost choking with passion; it was
so hard to be misconceived, even though she
had so much reason on her side.  Yet, since
I knew she was wrong, I almost wished to
shake her.
</p>

<p>
"No!" I said at last, "I will not go until
I have an understanding one way or the
other.  We have been beating about the
bush, but I will do it no longer.  You know
that I love you!"
</p>

<p>
She drew herself up.
</p>

<p>
"How many can you love at a time,
Mr. Ticehurst?" she said.
</p>

<p>
"One, only one," I replied.  "You are
utterly mistaken."
</p>

<p>
"I am not mistaken!" she said; "and I
think you are a coward and a traitor.  If
you were not, I might love you; but as you
are, such a thing is impossible."
</p>

<p>
I caught her by the wrist.  Instinctively
she tried to free herself, but finding she
could not, looked up.  When she caught my
eye, her indignant remonstrance died on her lips.
</p>

<p>
"Look you, Elsie, what can I do?
Perhaps I cannot defend myself; there are
some situations where a man cannot for the
sake of others.  I can say no more about
that.  And I will make you see you are
wrong, if not by proof, by showing you
what I am&mdash;a man incapable of what you
think me&mdash;and in the end I will make you
love me."  I paused for a moment, but she
did not move.
</p>

<p>
"You have listened to me; Elsie, and you
can see what I mean, you can think whether
I shall falter or swerve; and now I ask you,
for I am assured you do love me, or that you
did, whether you will not trust me now?
For you cannot believe that I could speak
as I do if I had done what you think."
</p>

<p>
I looked at Elsie, and she was very pale.
I could see that I had moved her, had
shaken her conviction, that she was at war
with herself.  I got up, went to the side,
and then turned, beckoning to her to look
over to seaward with me.  She came almost
like a woman walking in her sleep, and took
a place by my side.  I did so to avoid
notice, for I feared to attract attention;
indeed, I saw two passengers looking at us
curiously, one of whom smiled so that I
began to wish to throw him overboard.  Yet
I think, as a matter of fact, I did wrong in
allowing her to move; it broke the influence
I held over her in a measure, for I have
often noticed since that to obtain control of
some people one should keep steadily
insisting on the one point, and never allow
them to go beyond, or even to think beyond
it.  But then to do so one must be stronger
than I was, or he will lose control over
himself, as I did, and so make errors in
judgment.
</p>

<p>
"Elsie," I said quietly, "are you not
going to answer me?  Or am I not worth it?"
</p>

<p>
Now, up to this moment I had taken her
away from the past; in her emotion she had
almost forgotten Helen; she was just wavering
and was on the point of giving in to me.
Yet by that last suggestion of mine I
brought it back to her.  I could see in her
mind the darker depths of her fear and
distrust of me, and what I rightly judged
her hatred and jealousy of Helen.  Though I
do not think I know much of character, yet in
the state of mind that I was in then I seemed
to see her mind, as a much more subtle man
might have done, and my own error.  I could
have cursed my own folly.  She had taken
the book again, and was holding it open in
her hand.  Until I spoke she held it so
lightly that it shook and wavered, but she
caught it in both hands and shut it suddenly,
as though it was the book of her heart that
I had been reading, and she denied my right
to do it.  And she turned toward me cold
once more, though by a strange influence she
caught my thought.
</p>

<p>
"This is a closed book, Mr. Ticehurst.  It
is the book of the past, and&mdash;it is gone for
ever."  She dropped it over the side with a
mocking smile.  But I caught hold of her
hand and held it.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said I, "then we begin again.  If
the past is dead, the present lives, and the
future is yet unborn.  You mean one thing
now, and I mean the other; but in the
future we shall both mean the same.
Remember what I say, Elsie&mdash;remember it.
For unless I am dead, I will be your
acknowledged lover and your husband at last."
</p>

<p>
I dropped her hand and walked away, and
when I looked back I saw her following me
with her eyes.  I would have given much
then to have been able to know of what she
thought.  I went below and slept for many
hours a sleep of exhaustion, for though a
man may be as strong as a lion physically, an
excess of emotion takes more from him than
the most terrible physical toil.
</p>

<p>
The next morning we were in Victoria, and
I neither had, nor did I seek, an opportunity
of again speaking with Elsie.  But I did talk
for a few moments with Fanny.  I told her
some part of what occurred, but not much.
She said as much:
</p>

<p>
"You are keeping something back, Tom.
I think you know some reason why Elsie
won't have anything to do with you?"
</p>

<p>
"I do, Fanny," I replied: "but there is
nothing in it at all, and one of these days she
will discover it."
</p>

<p>
"I hope so," said she, a little dryly for so
young a girl; "but Elsie is a little obstinate,
and I have seen horses that would not jump a
gate.  You may have to open it yet, Tom."
</p>

<p>
"It may open of it itself, Fanny, or the
horse may desire the grass and jump at last;
but I will never open it myself."
</p>

<p>
And I shook hands with her and Mr. Fleming.
I took off my hat to Elsie, but
said in a low voice:
</p>

<p>
"Remember what I said, Elsie, for I shall
never forget."  And then she turned away;
but did not look back this time, as she had
done when we parted in the hotel.  Yet
such is the curious state a lover is in that I
actually comforted myself that she did not,
for if she had, I said, it would have showed
she was callous and cold.  Perhaps, though
she kept command over herself just for the
time, it failed her at the last, and she would
not let me see it.
</p>

<p>
When they were gone, Harmer and I went
ashore too.  As to the boy, he was so
desperately in love&mdash;calf-love&mdash;that I had to
cheer him up, and the way I did it makes me
laugh now, for I have a larger experience of
boys and men than I had then.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, Harmer," said I, "you will
get over this in no time&mdash;see if you don't."
</p>

<p>
He turned round in a blazing rage, and I
think if it had not been for the effects of the
old discipline, which was yet strong upon
him, he would have sworn at me; for
although Harmer looked as if butter wouldn't
melt in his mouth, I knew he had a very
copious vocabulary of abuse at his command,
such as one learns only too easily at sea.
</p>

<p>
"What, Mr. Ticehurst!" he said stammering.
"Get over it?  I never shall, and I
don't want to, and, what's more, I wouldn't
if I could!  It's not kind of you to say so,
and I think&mdash;I think&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What, Jack?" said I, thunderstruck at
this outburst, when I meant consolation.
</p>

<p>
"That you'll get over it first.  There
now!" said he, triumphant with this retort
I burst into laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;well, Harmer, I didn't mean to
vex you.  We must not quarrel now, for
Jordan's a hard road to travel, I believe, and
you and I have got to make lots of money;
at least you have; if we are going to do
anything in this country.  For it's what the
Yankees call a tough place."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Harmer, now ashamed of
of being angry.  "I heard one fellow say to
another on the steamer, 'You goldarned
fellers from the East think you're going to
get a soft seat over here, but you bet you'll
have to rustle on the Pacific Slope or else
git!'  And then he turned to me.  'D'ye
hear that, young feller?&mdash;you've got to rustle
right smart, or you'll get left.'"
</p>

<p>
And Jack laughed heartily trying to imitate
the accent of his adviser, but he found it
hard to disguise his own pure English, learnt
in a home far across the seas and the wide
stretch of the American Continent.
</p>

<p>
That night we stayed in Victoria in a rough
hotel kept by two brothers, Cornishmen, who
invited us both to have drinks on the strength
of our all being Englishman, though I should
never have suspected that they were such, so
well did their accent disguise the truth from
me.  And in the morning, two days after, we
went on board the <i>Western Slope</i> bound for
New Westminster, on the mainland of British
Columbia, whither the Flemings had preceded us.

<h3>
PART III.
<br /><br />
A GOLDEN LINK.
</h3>

<p>
What I have just written is but the
connecting link between two series of
events&mdash;the hyphen between two words;
and I shall not try to hurry on to the strange
drama of a few days to which all that precedes
it has been but the inevitable prologue,
without which there were no clear understanding
of its incidents.  I am going, therefore,
to dispose of a whole year's events in a
few words, though much occurred in that
time which might be worth relating, if I
were a professional writer, able to make
things interesting to all, or if I had the
faculty of making word-pictures of places
and scenes which stand out clearly before
me whenever I reflect, and the full times of
the past come up for review.
</p>

<p>
What Jack Harmer and I did for that
year truly would take ten times the space I
have allowed myself, and have been allowed,
and I shall say but little now if I can only
dispose of that twelve months in a way that
places my readers in a position to clearly
understand what passed in the thirteenth
month after I had landed in British Columbia.
</p>

<p>
Now on our landing we had but ¬£40
between us, and I was the possessor of nearly
all that amount, about two hundred dollars
in American currency.  It is true I had a
hundred and fifty pounds in England, which
I had sent for, and Harmer had quite coolly
asked his father for fifty, which I may state
here he did <i>not</i> get in a letter which advised
him to return to England, and go in for
something worth having before it was too late.
</p>

<p>
"He means the Civil Service, I know,"
said Jack, when he read the letter; "and I
hate the notion.  They are all fossils in it,
and if they have brains to start with, they
rarely keep them&mdash;why should they?
They're not half as much use as a friend at
court."
</p>

<p>
Perhaps he was right, yet I advised him
to take his father's advice, and he took
neither his nor mine, but stuck to me
persistently with a devotion that pleased and
yet annoyed me.  For I desired a free hand,
and with him I could not get it.  I had some
idea of going in for farming when I landed.
I would get a farm near Elsie's father, and
stay there.  But I found I hadn't sufficient
money, or anything like sufficient, to buy
land near Thomson Forks.  So I looked
round, and, in looking round, spent money.
Finally, I got Harmer something to do in a
sawmill on Burrard's Inlet, a position which
give him sufficient to live on, but very little
more; and yet he had not to work very hard,
in fact he tallied the lumber into the ships
loading in the Inlet for China and Australia, and
wrote to me that he liked his job reasonably
well, though he was grieved to be away
from me.  As for myself, I went up to
Thomson Forks, looked round me there,
and at the hotel fell in with a man named
Mackintosh, an American from Michigan, a
great strong fellow, with a long red beard,
and an eye like an eagle's, who was going
up in the Big Bend gold-hunting, prospecting
as they call it.  I told him, after we got
into conversation, that I wanted to go farming.
</p>

<p>
He snorted scornfully, and immediately
began to dilate on gold-mining and all the
chances a man had who possessed the grit to
tackle it.  And as I knew I really had too
little money to farm with, it wasn't long
before he persuaded me to be his partner and
go with him.  For I liked him at once, and
was feeling so out in the cold that I was
glad to chum with anyone who looked like
knowing his way about.  We were soon in
the thick of planning our campaign, and Mac
got very fluent and ornamental in his
language as he drank and talked.  However, I
did not mind that much, although his
blasphemy was British Columbian, and rather
worse than that in use on board ship.  Yet
people do not think the sea a mean school of
cursing.  Presently, as I turned round at the
bar, I saw Mr. Fleming, who did not notice
me until I spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Mr. Fleming," I said;
"will you drink with me?"
</p>

<p>
He turned round sharply at the sound
of my voice, and then shook my hand,
half doubtfully at first, and then more
heartily.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Ticehurst," he said at last, "I am
glad to see you, after all.  Hang it, I am! for"
(here he lowered his voice to a whisper)
"I don't care about the style of this place
after New South Wales.  They nearly all
carry revolvers here, damn it! as if they
were police; and last time I came in, my
man and another fellow fought, and Siwash
Jim (that's what they call him) tried to
gouge out the other chap's eyes.  And when
I pulled him off, the other men growled about
my spoiling a fight.  What do you think of
that?"
</p>

<p>
And the old man stared at me inquiringly,
and then laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Wish I could ask you over to the Creek,
but I can't, and you know why.  Take my
advice and go back to sea.  Now, look here,
let's speak plain.  I know you want Elsie;
but it's a mistake, my boy.  She didn't care
for you; and I know her, she's just like her
mother, the obstinatest woman you ever saw
when she made up her mind.  I wouldn't
mind much if she did care for you, though
perhaps you aint so rich as you ought to be,
Tom.  But then my wife had more money
than I had by a long sight, so I don't care
for that.  But seeing that Elsie doesn't want
you, what's the use?  Take my advice and
go to sea again."
</p>

<p>
Here he stopped and gave me the first
chance of speaking I had had since I
accosted him.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Mr. Fleming," I said firmly;
"but I can't go back yet.  I am glad you
have no great objection to me yourself, but
I believe that Elsie hasn't either, and I'm
bound to prove it; and I will."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you know best," he replied.  "But
mind your eye, old boy, when your friend the
Malay comes out.  I shouldn't like to be on
the same continent with him, if I were you."
</p>

<p>
"I don't like being either," I said.  "But
then it shows how fixed I am on one object.
And I shall not go, even if he were to find
out where I am.  For I might have to kill
him.  Yet I don't see how he can find out.
Nobody knows or will know, except my
brother, and he won't tell him."
</p>

<p>
Fleming shrugged his shoulders and
dropped the subject to take up his own
affairs.
</p>

<p>
"Damn this country, my boy! give me a
plain where I can see a few miles.  On my
soul, this place chokes me; I can't look out
five hundred yards for some thundering old
mountain!  At the Creek there are hills at
the back, at the front, and on both sides, and
nearly all are chokeful of trees, so that
riding after the cattle is worse than going after
scrub cattle in Australia.  I can't get the
hang of the place at all, and though I am
supposed to own nearly two hundred head of
cattle, I can't muster seventy-five on my own
place.  Some are up at Spullamacheen, some
on the Nicola, and others over at the Kettle
River on the border, for all I know.  And
the place is full of ca√±ons, as they call
gulches in this place; and thundering holes
they are, two hundred feet deep, with a
roaring stream at the bottom.  The Black
Ca√±on at the back of my place gives me the
shivers.  I am like a horse bred on the
plains; when it gets on the mountains it is
all abroad, and shivers at the sight of a
sharp slope.  I reckon I can ride on the
flat, old as I am, but here, if it wasn't for my
scoundrel Siwash Jim, who says he knows
the country like a book, I shouldn't know
where to go or what to do.  Here he comes,
the vagabond!"
</p>

<p>
I had learnt by this time that Siwash
means Indian, for in that country they say
Siwashes instead of Indians, so I thought
Jim was one of the natives.  However, I
saw at once he wasn't, for though he was
dark, his features were pure white.  He had
earned his nickname by living with the
Indians for so many years that he was more
at home with them than with white people,
and he had acquired all their vices as well
as a goodly stock of his own, probably
inherited.  He was a slightly built man of
about forty, with a low forehead, a sharp
aquiline nose, and no lips to speak of; his
mustache was short, and a mere line; his
teeth were black with smoking and chewing;
his legs bowed with continual riding.  He
wore mocassins, and kept his hair long.  He
was more than half intoxicated when he
came in, carrying a stock-whip coiled round
his neck.  He did not speak, but drank
stolidly; and when he looked at me, I
fancied it was with an air of dislike, as
though he had read my thoughts and knew
how I regarded him.
</p>

<p>
I drew Fleming aside.
</p>

<p>
"I don't like him," said I; "and wouldn't
trust him farther than I could swing a bull
by the tail.  Do the girls like him?"
</p>

<p>
"Like him!" repeated Fleming, "they
hate him, and want me to give him the
bounce, as they say here.  Elsie says he
looks like a murderer, and Fanny that he is
uglier than a Murrumbidgee black fellow.
But then he knows the country and does his
work, and don't want to go.  I don't care
much either way, for when I can get all the
cattle together and put the place in order I
shall sell out and go back.  Stay in British
Columbia&mdash;no, sir, I won't! not if they make
me Governor.  I tell you I like to be where
I can see ten miles.  Then I can breathe.  I
can go out at home and see all my station
and almost count the sheep and cattle from
my door; and here I have to ride up and
ride down, and I never know where I am.
I'm going back just as soon as I can."
</p>

<p>
And he went away then without asking
where I was going or whether I was doing
anything.  Next morning I jumped on board
the steamer with Mac and started for the
head of the Shushwap Lakes.  Thence we
went into the Big Bend, and though we
never made the millions Mac was always
prophesying about and hungering for, our
summer's work was not wasted.  For before
the season was over we had struck a rich
pocket and made about four thousand dollars
a piece.
</p>

<p>
Of course I wanted to up stick and go
back as soon as I had as much as that, but
Mac would not hear of it.
</p>

<p>
"No, Tom&mdash;no," said he; "there's more
here yet."
</p>

<p>
And he eyed me so entreatingly that I
caved in and promised to remain with him
prospecting, at any rate till the first snow.
</p>

<p>
But a week after making that agreement
we both went down to the Columbia for
more provisions.  Finding none there, we had
to make the farther journey to the Landing.
There I found a letter waiting for me from
Harmer, saying that he was tired of the
sawmill on the Inlet, and wanted to join me.  I
wrote back requesting him to be good
enough to stay where he was, but, to console
him, promised that if I saw any chance of his
doing better with me I would send for him.
He asked rather timidly for news of Fanny.
How could I give him news when I knew
nothing of Elsie?  Yet the simple mention
of the girl's name again made me anxious to
get back to the Forks, and if one of the
steamers had come up the lake I think I
should have deserted Mac in spite of my
promise.  Yet we had only brought down
half the gold that trip, perhaps because my
partner had made a calculation as to what I
might do, having it on me, if we got within
reach of some kind of civilization, and I
thought it best to secure the rest while I
could, though I thoroughly trusted Mac.  At
the same time that I answered Harmer's
letter I wrote one to my brother, telling
him both what I had done and what I
proposed doing later on.  And I begged him to
be careful, if he should be in San Francisco
then, of the Malay when his time was up.
For although his chief spite was against me,
yet Will was my brother, and I well remembered
the look that he had cast on him when
he was kicked in the struggle between Will
and myself.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the summer&mdash;and a beautiful
season it was in the wooded mountains&mdash;was
spent in very unsuccessful prospecting.  For
one thing, after our success Mac had taken to
prospecting for pockets; and if gold-mining
be like gambling as a general rule, that is
almost pure chance.  Once or twice he was
in high spirits at good indications, but on
following them up we were invariably
disappointed, and we had to start again.
August and September passed, and the
higher summits above us were already white
with snow, which fell on us in the lower
valleys as rain.  In October there was a
cessation of bad weather for a time, and Mac
promised himself a long fall season, but at
the end of it we woke one morning to find a
foot of snow on our very camping ground.
</p>

<p>
"We shall have to get up and get," said I
cheerfully, for I was glad of it.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!" said Mac; "this is nothing.
It will all go again by to-morrow; there will
be nothing to stop us from another week or
two.  Besides, yesterday I had a notion that
I saw something.  I didn't tell you, but I
found another bit of quartz&mdash;aye, richer than
the piece I showed you at the Forks, Tom,
and we've got to find out where it comes from."
</p>

<p>
I groaned, but, in spite of argument, there
was no moving him; and though I was
angry enough to have gone off by myself,
yet knowing neither the trail nor the country
well, I had no desire to get lost in the
mountains, which would most assuredly have
meant death to me.  However, I still remonstrated,
and at last got him to fix ten days as
the very longest time he would remain: I
was obliged to be content with that.
</p>

<p>
But Mac was sorry before the hour
appointed for our departure that he had not
taken my advice, "tenderfoot" and
Englishman though I was.  On the evening of the
eighth day the temperature, which had up to
that time been fairly warm in spite of our
altitude and the advanced season, fell
suddenly, and it became bitterly cold.  Our
ponies, who had managed to pick up a fair
living on the plateau where our camp stood,
and along the creek bottoms, came right up
to our tent, and one of them put his head
inside.  "Dick," as we called him, was a much
gentler animal than most British Columbian
cayuses, and had made a friend of me,
coming once a day at least for me to give him a
piece of bread, of which he had grown fond,
though at first he was as strange with it as a
young foal with oats.  I put up my hand
and touched his nose, which was soft and
silky, while the rest of his coat was long and
rough.  He whinnied gently, and I found a
crust for him, and then gently repulsing him,
I fastened the fly of the tent.  Mac was fast
asleep under his dark blankets, whence there
came sudden snorts like those a bear makes
in his covert, or low rumblings like thunder
from a thick cloud.
</p>

<p>
But it was he who woke me in the
morning, and he did it without ceremony.
</p>

<p>
"Get up, old man!" he said hurriedly,
while he was jamming himself, as it were,
into his garments.  "The snow's come at
last&mdash;and, by thunder, it's come to stay!
There's no time to be lost!"  And he
vanished into the white space outside.
</p>

<p>
When I followed I found him already at
work packing the ponies, and without any
words I set to, struck the tent, rolled it up,
and got together everything I thought
should go.  When I touched the tools Mac
turned round.
</p>

<p>
"Leave 'em, pard&mdash;leave 'em.  There's
plenty of weight without that.  Aye,
plenty&mdash;and too much!"
</p>

<p>
The last I only just caught, for it was said
to himself.  In half an hour we were off,
leaving behind us nearly three weeks'
provisions, all the tools but two light
shovels, and what remained after our
working the quartz.
</p>

<p>
"It's worth a thousand dollars," said Mac,
regretfully, "but without a proper crusher
it's only tailings."
</p>

<p>
We moved off camp, Mac first, leading
the nameless pony, which was the stronger
of the two, and I following with Dick.
</p>

<p>
The snow was two feet deep in many
parts, and in some drifts much more than
that.  Fortunately, the trail was for its
greater length well sheltered, both by
overhanging rocks and big trees, spruce,
cedar, hemlock, and pine, which helped to
keep it clear; but it was evident to me by
the way the ponies traveled, and the labor
it was for me to get along with no other
burden than the shovel, from which I
sometimes used to free Dick, that another
fall of snow would make traveling almost
impossible.  Mac walked on in somber
silence, reflecting doubtless that it was his
obstinacy which had brought us into
trouble, a thing I confess I was not so
forgiving as to forget, though merciful
enough not to remind him of it.  It had
taken us three days to come up from the
Columbia, and it seemed barely possible
under the circumstances to retrace our steps
in the same time, even although the horses
were not so much burdened and there was
not so much hard climbing to be done.  But
I could see Mac was bent on getting out, and
he traveled without more rest than we were
absolutely compelled to take on account of
the animals.  As for myself, I confess that
though I had traveled that same trail twice,
yet so greatly was it altered by the snow
that I should have lost my way in the
first mile.  For mountaineering and the
knowledge of locality are things not to be
learnt in a hurry, they must come by long
custom, or by native instinct.
</p>

<p>
Sorrowfully&mdash;for I am always loth to
harm even a noxious animal, as long as it
leaves me alone&mdash;I suggested to Mac that we
should leave the horses.  He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Who'll carry the provisions, then?" said he.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think we can get to the Landing,
Mac?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"We shall be lucky," he answered, with a
significant nod, "if we get to the other side of
the Columbia.  Tom, I think I have let you
in for a winter up here, unless you care about
snow-shoeing it over the other pass.  I was a
fool&mdash;say yes to that if you like."
</p>

<p>
It was late when we camped, but my
partner was in better spirits than he had been
at noon when we held the above conversation,
for we had done, by dint of forced
marching, quite as much as we did in fine
weather.  But the ponies were very tired,
and there was nothing for them to eat, or
next to nothing, for the grass was deeply
buried.  I gave Dick a little bread, however,
and the poor animal was grateful for it, and
stood by me all night, until, at the earliest
dawn, we packed them again with a load that
was lighter by the day's food of two men,
and heavier to them by a day's hard toil and
starvation.
</p>

<p>
Toward the afternoon of that, the second
day, we came to the hardest part of the whole
trail, for, on crossing a river which was
freezing cold, we had to climb the side of an
opposing mountain.  Mac's pony traveled
well, and though he showed evident signs of
fatigue, he was in much better case than
mine, who every now and again staggered, or
sobbed audibly with a long-drawn breath.  I
drew Mac's attention to it, but he shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"He must go on, there's no two ways about
it."  And he marched off.  I went behind
Dick and pushed him for a while, and though
I tired myself, yet I am not sorry for what I
did, even that little assistance was such a
relief to the poor wretched animal who, from
the time he was able to bear a weight, had
been used by a packer without rest or peace,
as though he were a machine, and whose only
hope of release was to die, starved, wounded,
saddle and girth galled, of slow starvation at
last.  Such is the lot of the pack horse, and,
though poor Dick's end was more merciful,
his fellows have no better fate to expect,
while their life is a perpetual round of
ill-usage and hard work.
</p>

<p>
By about four o'clock in the afternoon the
sky grew overcast, and the light feathery
flakes of snow came at first slowly, and then
faster, turning what blue distances we caught
sight of to a gray, finally hiding them.  Dick
by this time was almost at a standstill.  I
never thought I was a very tender-hearted
man, and never set up to be; indeed, if he
had been only stubborn, I might have
thrashed him in a way some folks would
call cruel; and yet, being compelled to urge
him, both for his sake and my own, I
confess my heart bled to see his suffering and
wretchedness.  Having scarcely the strength
to lift his feet properly, he had struck his
fetlocks against many projecting stones and
roots until the blood ran down and congealed
on his little hoofs, which were growing
tender, as I could see by the way he winced
on a rockier piece of the trail than common.
His rough coat was standing up and
staring like that of a broken-haired terrier,
in spite of the sweat which ran down his
thin sides and heaving flanks; while every
now and again he stumbled, and with difficulty
recovered himself.
</p>

<p>
When we came to the divide, just as if
he had said that he would do so much for
us, he stumbled again, and fell on the level
ground, cutting his knees deeply.  Mac heard
the noise, and, leaving his pony standing, he
came back to me.
</p>

<p>
"He's done up, poor devil!" said he;
"he'll go no further.  What shall we do?"
</p>

<p>
I shook my head, for it was not I who
arranged or ordered things when Mac was
about.  He was silent for a while.
</p>

<p>
"There's nothing for it," he said at last,
"but one thing.  We must put all the other
kieutan can stand on him."
</p>

<p>
By this time I had got the pack off Dick,
and he lay down perfectly flat upon his side,
with the blood slowly oozing from his knees,
and his flanks still heaving from the
exertions which had brought him up the hill to
die on the top of it.
</p>

<p>
"Come on," said Mac, as he moved off with
what he meant to put on the other pony.
</p>

<p>
But at first I could not go.  I put my hand
in my pocket, took out a piece of bread, and,
kneeling down by the poor animal, I put it to
his lips.  He mumbled it with his teeth and
dropped it out.  Then in my hat I got some
water out of a little pool and offered it to
him.  He drank some and then fell back
again.  I took my revolver from my belt,
stroked his soft nose once more, and, putting
the weapon to his head between his eye and
ear, I fired.  He shivered all over, stiffened a
little, and all was still except for the slow
drip of the blood that ran out of his ear from
a vein the ball had divided.  Then I went
on&mdash;and I hope no one will think me weak
if I confess my sight was not quite so clear
as it had been before, and if there was a
strange haziness about the cruelly cold trail
and mountain side that did not come from
the falling snow.
</p>

<p>
At our camp that night we spoke little
more than was absolutely necessary, and
turned in as soon as we had eaten supper,
drunk a tin of coffee, and smoked a couple of
pipes.  Fortunately for the remaining horse,
in the place we had reached there was a little
feed, a few tussocks of withering frost-nipped
bunch grass, which he ate greedily to the last
roots his sharp teeth could reach.  And then
he pawed or "rustled" for more, using his
hoof to bare what was hidden under the
snow.  But for that we should have left him
on the trail next morning.
</p>

<p>
The toil and suffering of the third day's
march were dreadful, for I grew footsore, and
my feet bled at the heels, while the skin rose
in blisters on every toe, which rapidly
became raw.  But Mac was a man of iron, and
never faltered or grew tired; and his
example, and a feeling of shame at being
outdone by another, kept me doggedly behind
him at a few paces' distance.  How the pony
stood that day was a miracle, for he must
have been made of iron and not flesh and
blood to carry his pack, while climbing up
and sliding down the steep ascents and slopes
of the hills, while every few yards some
wind-felled tree had to be clambered over
almost as a dog would do it.  He was always
clammy with sweat, but he seemed in better
condition than on the second day, perhaps on
account of the grass he had been able to get
during the night.  Yet he had had to work
all night to get it, while I and Mac had slept
in the torpor of great exhaustion.
</p>

<p>
Late in the evening we came to the banks
of the Columbia, across which stretched sandy
flats and belts of scrub, until the level ended,
and lofty mountains rose once more, covered
with snow and fringed with sullen clouds,
thousands of feet above where we stood.
Mac stopped, and looked anxiously across the
broad stream; and when he saw a faint curl
of bluish smoke rising a mile away in the
sunless air, he pointed to it with a more
pleased expression that I had seen on his face
since he had roused me so hurriedly on that
snowy morning three days ago.
</p>

<p>
"There is somebody over there, at any
rate, old man," he said almost cheerfully,
"though I don't know what the thunder
they're doing here, unless it's Montana Bill
come up trapping.  He said he was going to
do it, but if so, what's he doing down here?"
</p>

<p>
"Can't he trap here, then?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Well," replied Mac, "this might be the
end of his line; but still, he ought to be
farther up in the hills.  There isn't much
to trap close down on this flat.  You see
trappers usually have two camps, and they
walk the line during the day, and take out
what is caught in the night, setting the
traps again, and sleeping first at one end and
then at the other.  However, we shall see
when we get across."  And he set about
lighting a fire.
</p>

<p>
When we had crossed before there had
been a rough kind of boat built out of pine
slabs, which was as crazy a craft to go in as
a butter-tub.  It had been made by some
hunters the winter before, and left there
when they went west in the early spring,
before we came up.  I asked Mac what had
become of it, for it was not where we had
left it, hauled up a little way on a piece of
shingle and tied to a stump.
</p>

<p>
"Somebody took it," he said, "or more
likely, when the water rose after we crossed,
it was carried away.  Perhaps it's in the
Pacific by this."
</p>

<p>
I went down to the stump, and found
there the remains of the painter, and as it
had been broken violently and not cut, I
saw that his last suggestion was probably
correct.
</p>

<p>
We sat down to supper by our fire, which
gleamed brightly in the gathering darkness
on the surrounding snow and the waters
close beneath us, and ate some very vile
bacon and a greasy mess of beans which we
had cooked the night before we left our
mountain camp.
</p>

<p>
"How are we going to cross, Mac?" said
I, when we had lighted our pipes.
</p>

<p>
"Build a raft," said he.
</p>

<p>
"And then?"
</p>

<p>
"When we are over?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Why, stay there, I guess, if it snows any
more.  One more fall of heavy snow will
block Eagle Pass as sure as fire's hot!"
</p>

<p>
I shrugged my shoulders.  Though I had
been expecting this, it was not pleasant to
have the prospect of spending a whole winter
mewed up in the mountains, so close before me.
</p>

<p>
"Does it get very cold here?" I asked at
length, when I had reflected for a while.
</p>

<p>
He nodded sardonically.
</p>

<p>
"Does it get cold?  Is it cold now?"
</p>

<p>
I drew closer to the fire for an answer.
</p>

<p>
"Then this is nothin'&mdash;nothin' at all.  It
would freeze the tail off a brass monkey up
here.  It goes more than forty below zero
often and often; and it's a worse kind of cold
than the cold back east, for it's damper here,
and not so steady.  Bah!  I wish I was a
bear, so as to hole up till spring."
</p>

<p>
All of which was very encouraging to a
man who had mostly sailed in warm latitudes,
and hated a frost worse than poison.  And
it didn't please me to see that so good-tempered
a man as Mac was really put out and
in a vile humor, for he knew what I could
only imagine.
</p>

<p>
The conversation&mdash;if conversation it could
be called&mdash;flagged very soon, and we got out
our blankets, scraping away the snow from
a place, where we lay close to each other in
order to preserve what warmth we could.
We lay in the position commonly called in
America "spooning," like two spoons fitting
one into another, so that there had to be
common consent for changing sides, one of
which grew damp while the other grew cold.
Just as we were settling down to sleep we
heard the sudden crack of a rifle from the
other shore, and against the wind came a
"halloa" across the water, Mac sat up very
unconcernedly; but, as for me, I jumped as
if I had been shot, thinking of course at first
that the shot had been fired by Indians,
though I knew there were no hostile tribes
in that part of British Columbia, where,
indeed, most of the Indians are very peaceable.
</p>

<p>
"I told you so," said Mac; "that's Montana
Bill's rifle.  I sold it him myself.  He's
the only man up here that carries a Sharp."
</p>

<p>
He rose, and went down to the water's
edge.  "Halloa!" he shouted, in his turn,
and in the quietness of the windless air I
heard it faintly repeated in distant echoes.
</p>

<p>
"Is that you, Mac?" said the mysterious voice.
</p>

<p>
"You bet it is!" answered my partner,
in a tone that ought to have been heard on
the Arrow Lake.
</p>

<p>
"Bully old boy!" said Bill faintly, as it
seemed.  "Do you know me?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye, I reckon I know old Montana's
bellow!" roared Mac.
</p>

<p>
"Then I'll see you in the morning, pard!"
came the voice again, after which there was
silence, broken only by the faint lap of the
water on the shingle, as it slipped past, and
the snort of our pony as he blew the snow
out of his nostrils, vainly seeking for a tuft
of grass.
</p>

<p>
We rose at earliest dawn, and saw Montana
Bill slowly coming over the level.  He
sat down while Mac and I built a raft, and
fashioned a couple of rude paddles with the ax.
</p>

<p>
"Is the pony coming across, Mac?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"We'll try it, but it's his own lookout,"
said he; "if he won't come easy we shan't
drag him, for we shall hev to paddle to do it
ourselves."
</p>

<p>
Fortunately for him he did want to go
over, and, having a long lariat round his neck,
he actually swam in front of us, and gave us
a tow instead of our giving him one.
</p>

<p>
As we were going over, Mac said to me:
</p>

<p>
"I never thought I'd be glad to see Montana
Bill before.  He's got more gas and
blow about him than'd set up a town, and
he's no more good at bottom&mdash;that is, he
aint no more grit in him than a clay bank,
though to hear him talk you'd think he'd
mor'n a forty-two inch grindstone.  But I
hope he's got a good stock of grub."
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes we touched bottom, and
we shook hands with the subject of Mac's
eulogium, who looked as bold as brass, as
fierce as a turkeycock, and had the voice of
a man-o'-war's bo'son.  We took the lariat
off the pony, and turned him adrift.
</p>

<p>
"Did you fellows strike it?" said Bill, the
first thing.
</p>

<p>
"Enough to pay for our winter's board, I
reckon," said Mac.  "Have you got plenty
of grub?"
</p>

<p>
Bill nodded, using the common American
word for yes, which is a kind of cross-breed
between "yea" and the German "Ja,"
pronounced short like "ye."
</p>

<p>
"You bet I've plenty.  Old Hank kem
up with me, and then he cleared out again.
He and I kind of disagreed first thing, and
he just skinned out.  Good thing too&mdash;for him!"
</p>

<p>
And Bill looked unutterable things.
</p>

<p>
"Is there any chance of getting out over
the pass?" asked Mac.
</p>

<p>
"If you can fly," answered Bill.  "Drifts
is forty foot deep in parts, and soft too.  I
could hardly get on snow-shoein' it.  Better
stay and trap with me.  Better'n gold-huntin'
any time, and more dollars in it."
</p>

<p>
"Why aint you farther up in the hills?"
asked Mac, as we tramped along.
</p>

<p>
"Dunno," said Bill; "I allers camp here
every year.  It's kind of clear, and there's a
chance for the cayuses to pick a bit to keep
bones and hide together.  Besides, I feel
more freer down here.  I see more than 'ull
do me of the hills walking the line."
</p>

<p>
And with that we came to his camp.
</p>

<p>
Now, if I tell all that happened during
that winter, which was, all round, the most
uncomfortable and most unhappy one I ever
spent, for I had so much time to think of
Elsie, and how some other man more to her
mind might go to windward of me in
courting her&mdash;why, I should not write one book,
but two, which is not my intention now.
Besides, I have been long enough coming to
the most serious part of my history to tire
other people, as it has tired me; although
I could not exactly help it, because all, or at
least nearly all, that happened between the
time I was on the <i>Vancouver</i> and the time we
all met again seems important to me, especially
as it might have gone very differently if I had
never been gold-hunting in the Selkirks, or
even if I had got out of the mountains in the
fall instead of the following spring.  For
things seem linked together in life, and, in
writing, one must put everything in unless
more particular description becomes tedious,
because of its interfering with the story.
And though trapping is interesting enough,
yet I am not writing here about that or hunting,
which is more interesting still; and when
a man tells me a yarn he says is about a
certain thing, I don't want him to break off in
the middle to say something quite different,
any more than I like a man to get up in
the middle of a job of work, such as a long
splice which is wanted, to do something he
wasn't ordered to do.  It's only a way of
doing a literary Tom Cox's traverse, "three
times round the deck house, and once to
the scuttle-butt"&mdash;just putting in time, or
making what a literary friend of mine calls
"padding."
</p>

<p>
So folks who read this can understand
why I shall say nothing of this long and
weary winter, and, if they prefer it, they can
think that we "holed up," as Mac said, like
the bears, and slept through it all.  For in
the next part of this yarn it will be spring,
with the snow melting fast, and the trail
beginning to look like a path again that even a
sailor, who was not a mountaineer, could
hope to travel on without losing his life, or
even his way.

<h3>
PART IV.
<br /><br />
LOVE AND HATE.
</h3>

<p>
It had been raining for a week in an
incessant torrent, while the heavy clouds hung
low down the slopes of the sullen, sunless
mountains, when we struck camp in the
spring-time, and loaded our gaunt
pack-ponies for the rapidly opening trail.  Our
road lay for some twenty miles on the
bottom of a flat, which closed in more and
more as we went east, until we were in the
heart of the Gold Range.  The path was
liquid mud, in which we sank to the tops of
our long boots, sometimes even leaving them
embedded there; and the ponies were nearly
"sloughed down" a dozen times in the day.
At the worst places we were sometimes
compelled to take off their packs, which we
carried piecemeal to firmer ground, and there
loaded them again.  It had taken us but
four or four and a half days to cross it on
our last trip, and now we barely reached
Summit Lake in the same time.
</p>

<p>
Yet, in spite of the miserable weather and
our dank and dripping condition, in spite of
the hard work and harder idleness, when
wind and rain made it almost impossible to
sleep, I was happy&mdash;far happier than I had
been since the time I had so miserably failed
to make Elsie believe what I told her; for
now I was going back to her with the results
of my long toil, and there was nothing to
prevent my staying near her, perhaps on a
farm of my own, until she should recognize
her error at last.  Yet, I thought it well to
waste no time, for though I had to a
great extent got rid of my fears concerning
that wretched Matthias, still his imprisonment
had but a few more months to run, and
he <i>might</i> keep his word and his sworn oath.
I wished to win her and wear her before that
time, and after that, why, I did not care, I
would do my best, and trust in Providence,
even if I trusted in vain.
</p>

<p>
I have often thought since that it was
strange how much John Harmer was in my
mind, from daylight even to dark, during the
sixth day of our toilsome tramp over Eagle
Pass, for his image often unaccountably came
before me, and even dispossessed the fair face
of her whom I loved.  But it was so, and
no time during that day should I have been
very much surprised, though perhaps a little
angry, to see him come round a bend in the
trail, saying half humbly and half
impudently, as he approached me, "How do
you do, Mr. Ticehurst?"  I almost began to
believe after that day in second sight,
clairvoyance, and all the other mysterious things
which most sensible people look upon as
they do on charlatanry and the juggling in a
fair, for my presentiments came true in such
a strange way; even if it was only an accident
or mere coincidence after all.  Yet I have
seen many things put down as "coincidences"
which puzzled me, and wiser people
than Tom Ticehurst.
</p>

<p>
We had camped in a wretchedly miserable
spot, which had nothing to recommend it
beyond the fact that there really was some
grass there; for the wall of rock on our
right, which both Mac and Bill considered a
protection from the wind, acted as break-winds
often do, and gave us two gales in
opposite directions, instead of one.  So the
wind, instead of sweeping over us and going
on its way, fought and contended over our
heads, and only ceased for a moment to rush
skrieking again about our ears as it leapt on
the fire and sent the embers here and there,
while the rain descended at every possible
angle.  Perhaps it was on account of the
fizzing of the water in the fire, the rattle
of the branches overhead, and the whistling
of the wind, that we heard no one approaching
our grumbling company until they were
right upon us.  I was just then half a dozen
paces out in the darkness, cutting up some
wood for our fire, and as the strangers
approached the light, I let fall my ax so
that it narrowly escaped cutting off my big
toe, for one of the two I saw was a boy,
and that boy John Harmer!  I slouched my
big hat down over my eyes, and with some
wood in my arms I approached the group
and replenished the fire.  John was talking
with quite a Western twang, as though
he was determined not to be taken for an
Englishman.
</p>

<p>
"Rain!" he was saying; "well, you bet
it's something like it!  On the lake it takes
an old hand to know which is land and
which is water.  Old Hank was nearly
drowned in his tent the other day."
</p>

<p>
"Serve him right!" growled Bill.  "But
who are you, young feller?&mdash;I never see you
before, and I mostly know everybody in this
country."
</p>

<p>
Harmer looked up coolly, and taking off
his hat, swung it round.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he answered, "I aint what you'd
call celebrated in B.C. yet, and so you
mightn't have heard of me.  But if you
know everybody, perhaps you know Tom
Ticehurst and can tell me where he is to
be found.  For I am looking for him."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you are, are you?" said Bill.
"Then what's he been doing that you want
him so bad as to come across in this trail this
weather?"
</p>

<p>
"He hasn't been doing anything that I
know, pard," said Jack; "but I know he
was up here with a man named Mackintosh."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  I know him," replied Bill, "in fact,
I've seen him lately.  Is Tom Ticehurst a
little chap with red hair and a squint?"
</p>

<p>
"No, he isn't!" shouted Jack, as if he had
been libeled instead of me.  "He's a good
looking fellow, big enough to eat you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, is he?" sneered the joker.  "I tell
you what, young feller, it would take a big
man to chew up Montana Bill's little finger."
</p>

<p>
Harmer burst out laughing.
</p>

<p>
"So you're Montana Bill, are you?" said he.
</p>

<p>
"I am," answered Bill as gravely as if it
were a kingly title.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, old Hank said he could eat
you up without pepper or salt.  He's as mad
at you as a man can be; says he's been
practicing shooting all the winter on purpose
to do you up, and he puts a new edge on his
knife every morning."
</p>

<p>
"That'll do, young feller," put in Mac,
seeing that Bill was getting in a rage, and
knowing that he was just the man to have
a row with a youngster.  "You're a little
too fast, you are.  My name's Mackintosh, if
you want anyone of that name."
</p>

<p>
"Do I want you!" cried Harmer anxiously;
"of course I do!  Do you know where
Ticehurst is?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Mac; while I stood close
beside Harmer looking down at the fire so
that he couldn't see my face&mdash;I was laughing so.
</p>

<p>
"Then where is he?  Hang it! has anything
happened to him that you fellows make
such a mystery about it?" he asked getting a
little alarmed, as I could tell by the tone of
his voice.
</p>

<p>
"Well," replied Mac quietly, "I'll tell you.
He was up in the hills with me, and we
struck it rich&mdash;got a lot of gold, we did, you
bet we did," he went on in an irritating
drawl; "and then came down when the snow
flew.  We had such a time getting out, young
feller, and then at last we came to the
Columbia and there&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He was drowned?" said Harmer growing pale.
</p>

<p>
"No, he warn't," replied Mac.  "We got
across all right, and stayed all winter trapping
with Bill here.  And let me tell you, young
man, you mustn't trifle with Bill.  He's a
snorter, he is."
</p>

<p>
I could see "Damn Bill!" almost on Jack's
lips, but he restrained it.
</p>

<p>
"And when the Chinook came up, and the
snow began to melt a few days back, we all
got ready to cross the range&mdash;him, and Bill,
and me.  That's six days ago.  And a better
fellow than him you never struck, no, nor
will.  What do you think, pard?" he asked
with a grin, turning to me.
</p>

<p>
I grunted.
</p>

<p>
"And, young feller," Mac went on again,
"if he's a pardner of yours, or a shipmate&mdash;for
I can see you're an Englishman&mdash;why, I'm
glad he's here and safe."
</p>

<p>
Then suddenly altering his tone, he turned
fiercely on Harmer, who jumped back in alarm.
</p>

<p>
"Why the thunder don't you shake
hands with him?  There he is a-waitin'."
</p>

<p>
And John sprang across the fire and caught
me by both hands.
</p>

<p>
"Confound it, Mr. Ticehurst, how very
unkind of you!" he said, with tears in his
eyes.  "I began to think you were dead."  And
he looked unutterably relieved and
happy, but bursting with some news, I could see.
</p>

<p>
"Wait till supper, Jack," said I; "and
then tell me.  But I'm glad to see you."
</p>

<p>
I was too, in spite of his leaving the Inlet
without asking me.
</p>

<p>
As to the man with whom he came, Montana
Bill knew him, and they spent their
time in bullying the absent Hank Patterson.
It appeared that Harmer had hired him to
come and hunt for me as far as the Columbia
River, in order to bury me decently, as ne
had been firmly convinced that I was dead,
when he learnt no news of me at the Landing.
</p>

<p>
The whole five of us sat down to beans
and bacon; but I and Harmer ate very little
because he wanted to tell me something
which I was strangely loth to hear, so sure
was I that it could be nothing good.  It
certainly must be bad news to bring even an
impulsive youngster from the coast to the
Columbia in such weather.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what is it, Harmer?" said I at last.
</p>

<p>
He hesitated a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Is it anything about her?" I asked
quietly, lest the others should overhear.
</p>

<p>
"Who?  Miss F.?" he asked.  I nodded,
and he shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"It's no such luck," he went on; "but I
am so doubtful of what I have to tell you,
although a few hours ago I was sure enough
that I didn't know how to begin.  When
Mat's sentence be up, Mr. Ticehurst?"
</p>

<p>
I had no need to reckon.
</p>

<p>
"The 15th of August, Jack."
</p>

<p>
He looked at me, and then bent over
toward me.
</p>

<p>
"It's up already, sir."
</p>

<p>
"What, is he dead, then?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, but he has escaped."
</p>

<p>
And he filled his pipe while I gathered
myself together.  It was dreadfully
unfortunate if it were true.
</p>

<p>
"How do you know this?" I said at length,
</p>

<p>
"I saw him in New Westminster one night."
</p>

<p>
"The deuce you did!  Harmer, are you sure?"
</p>

<p>
The lad looked uncomfortable, and wriggled
about on his seat, which was the old stump
of a tree felled by some former occupants of
our camping ground.
</p>

<p>
"I should have been perfectly sure, if I
hadn't thought he was in the penitentiary,"
he said finally; "but still, I don't think I
can have mistaken his face, even though I
only caught sight of it just for a moment
down in the Indian town.  I was sitting in
a cabin with two other fellows and some
klootchmen, and I saw him pass.  There was
not much light, and he was going quick, but
I jumped up and rushed out after him.  But
in the rain and darkness he got away, if he
thought anyone was following him; or I
missed him."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad you did, my boy; he would
have thought little of putting his knife into
you," and here I rubbed my own shoulder
mechanically.  "Besides, if he had seen you,
that would have helped him to track me.
But then, how in the name of thunder (as
Mac says) did he come here at all!  It can't
be chance.  Did you look up the San Francisco
papers to see if anything was reported
as to his escape?"
</p>

<p>
Harmer brightened as if glad to answer
that he had done what I considered he ought
to have done.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, I did; but I found nothing
about it, nothing at all."
</p>

<p>
I reflected a little, and saw nothing clearly,
after all, but the imperative necessity of my
getting down to the Forks.  If Mat were
loose, why, I should have to be very careful,
it was true; but perhaps he might be retaken,
though I did not know if a man could
be extradited for simply breaking prison.
And if he came up country, and couldn't
find me, he might take it into his Oriental
skull to harm anyone I knew.  The thought
made me shiver.
</p>

<p>
"Did you stay at Thomson Forks,
Harmer?" I asked, to try and turn the dark
current of my thoughts.
</p>

<p>
He blushed a little.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, but only a day.  I saw no one,
though."
</p>

<p>
"What, not even Fanny?"
</p>

<p>
"No, but I wrote to her and told her I
was going up the Lakes to see what had
become of you."
</p>

<p>
"That was kind of you, Jack," said I; "I
mean it was kind of you to come up here.
How do you like the country, eh?"
</p>

<p>
He turned round comically, shrugged his
shoulders, and said nothing.  I could see
that early spring in the mountains did not
please him, especially as we were in the Wet
Belt.
</p>

<p>
But if he did not like the country, I found
he could stand it well, for he was as hardy
as a pack pony, and never complained, not
though we were delayed a whole day by the
rain, and on our return to the Landing had
to go to Thomson Forks in Indian dugouts.
When we did arrive there it was fine at last,
and the sun was shining brilliantly.
</p>

<p>
Mac, Harmer, and I were greeted in the
friendliest manner at the hotel by Dave, the
bar-tender, who was resplendent with a white
shirt of the very finest get up, and diamond
studs.  He stood us drinks at once.
</p>

<p>
"You're welcome to it, gentlemen, and
more too.  For we did think down here that
you had been lost in the snow.  We never
expected to hear of you again.  I think a
young lady round here must have an interest
in you, Mr. Ticehurst," said he knowingly,
"for only two days ago she called me out
and asked more than particularly about you.
When I told her nobody knew enough to
make a line in 'Local Items,' unless they
said, 'Nothing has yet been heard,' I reckon
she was sorry."
</p>

<p>
"Who was it, Dave?" I asked carelessly
"Was it Miss Fanny Fleming?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, it was not; it was Miss Fleming
herself, and I must say she's a daisy.  The
best looking girl between the Rocky
Mountains and the Pacific, gentlemen!  Miss
Fanny is nice&mdash;a pretty girl I will say;
but&mdash;&mdash;"  He stopped and winked, so that I
could hardly keep from throwing my glass at
his carefully combed and oiled head.  But I
was happy to think that Elsie had asked
after me.
</p>

<p>
In the morning we got horses from Ned
Conlan, and rode over to Mr. Fleming's ranch,
which was situated in a long low valley,
that terminated a mile above his house in a
narrow gulch, down which the creek came.
On either side were high hills, covered on
their lower slopes with bunch grass and bull
pines, and higher up with thick scrub, that
ran at last into bare rock, on the topmost
peaks of which snow lay for nine months of
the year.  As we approached the farm, we
saw a few of the cattle on the opposing
slopes; and on the near side of the valley
were the farm-buildings and the house itself,
which was partly hidden in trees.  We tied
our horses to the fence, and marched in, as we
fancied, as bold as brass in appearance; but
if Harmer felt half as uncomfortable as I did,
which I doubt, I am sorry for him.  The
first person we saw was Fanny, and the first
thing she did was to upset her chair on the
veranda on the top of a sleeping dog, who
at first howled, and then made a rush at us
barking loudly.
</p>

<p>
"Down, Di!" cried Fanny.  "How dare
you!  O Mr. Ticehurst, how glad I am
you're not dead!  And you, too, Mr. Harmer,
though no one said you were!  Oh, where's
father, I wonder&mdash;he'll be glad, too!"
</p>

<p>
"And Elsie, will she be glad as well,
Fanny?" I asked.  She looked at me slyly,
and nodded.
</p>

<p>
"You'd better ask her, I think.  Here
comes father."
</p>

<p>
He rode up on horseback, followed by
Siwash Jim, swinging the noose of a lariat in
his right hand, as though he had been after
horses or cattle.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's you, Tom, is it?" said Fleming,
who was looking very well.  "I'm glad
you're not quite so dead as I was told.  And
you, Harmer, how are you?  Jim, take these
gentlemen's horses to the stable.  You've
come to stay for dinner, of course.  I shan't
let you go.  I heard you did very well
gold-gambling last fall.  Come in!"  For that
news went down the country when we went
to the Landing for grub.
</p>

<p>
I followed, wondering a little whether
he would have been quite so effusive if I
had done badly.  But I soon forgot that
when I saw Elsie, who had just come out of
her room.  I thought, when I saw her, that
she was a little paler than when we had last
met, though perhaps that was due to the
unaccustomed cold and the sunless winter;
but she more than ever merited the rough
tribute which Dave had paid her in Conlan's
bar.  She was very beautiful to them; but
how much more to me, as she came up, a little
shyly, and shook hands softly, saying that
she was glad that the bad news they had
heard of me was not true.  I fancied that she
had thought of me often during that winter,
and perhaps had seen she had been unjust.
At any rate, there was a great difference
between what she was then and what she was now.
</p>

<p>
We talked during dinner about the winter,
which the three Australians almost cursed;
in fact, the father did curse it very admirably,
while Elsie hardly reproved his strong
language, so much did she feel that forty
degrees below zero merited all the opprobrium
that could be cast on it.  I described
our gold-mining adventures and the
winter's trapping, which, by the way, had
added five hundred dollars to my other money.
</p>

<p>
I told Fleming that I was now worth, with
some I still had at home, more than five
thousand dollars, and I could see it gave him
satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think of the country now,
Mr. Fleming?" I asked; "and how long
shall you stay here?"
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, my boy," he answered; "I
think, in spite of the cold, we shall have to
stand another winter here.  This summer I
must rebuild the barns and stables; there
are still a lot of cattle adrift somewhere;
and I won't sell out under a certain sum.
That's business, you know; and I have just a
little about me, though I am an old fool at
times, when the girls want their own way."
</p>

<p>
"What would you advise me to do?" said
I, hoping he would give me some advice
which I could flatter him by taking.  "You
see, when one has so much money, it is only
the correct thing to make more of it.  The
question is how to do it."
</p>

<p>
"That's quite right, Ticehurst&mdash;quite
right!" said he energetically.  "I'm glad
you talk like that; your head's screwed on
right; you will be well in yet" (an
Australian phrase for our "well off"), "I'll bet on
that.  Well, you can open a store, or go
lumbering, or gold-mining, or hunting, or raise
cattle, like me."
</p>

<p>
I pretended to reflect, though I nearly
laughed at catching Harmer's eye, for he
knew quite well what I wanted to do.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mr. Fleming, you're right.  That's
nearly all one can do.  But as to keeping a
store, you see, I've been so accustomed to an
open-air life, I don't think it would suit me.
Besides, a big man like me ought to do
something else than sell trousers!  As to
gold-mining, I've done that, and been lucky once,
which, in such a gambling game, is against
me.  And hunting or trapping&mdash;well, there's
nothing great in that.  I think I should
prefer cattle-raising, if I could do it.  I was
brought up on a farm in England, and why
shouldn't I die on one in British Columbia,
or" (and I looked at Elsie) "in Australia?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite right, Tom," said Fanny, laughing,
for she was too cute to miss seeing what I meant.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Fleming looked at me approvingly.
</p>

<p>
"You'll die worth a lot yet, Tom Ticehurst.
I like your spirit.  I was just the
same once.  Now, I'll tell you what.  Did
you ever see George Nettlebury at the Forks?"
</p>

<p>
"No," I replied, "not that I know of."
</p>

<p>
"I dare say you have," said he; "he's
mostly drunk; and Indian Alice, who is
always with him, usually has a black eye, as
a gentle reminder that she belongs to an
inferior race, if she is his wife.  Now, he
lives about two miles from here, over
yonder" (he pointed over the valley).  "He
has a house&mdash;a very dirty one now, it is true;
a stable, and a piece of meadow, fenced in,
where he could raise good hay if he would
mend the fence and keep other folks' cattle
out.  He told me the other day that he was
sick to death of this place, and he wants just
enough to go East with, and return to his
old trade of shipbuilding.  He says he will
take $300 for the whole place, with
what is on it.  That don't amount to much&mdash;two
cows, one old steer, and a cayuse he
rides round on.  If you like, we'll go over
and see him.  You can buy it, and buy some
more cattle, and if you have more next
winter than you can feed, I'll let you have
the hay cheap.  What do you say?"
</p>

<p>
My heart leapt up, but I pretended I
wanted time to think about it.
</p>

<p>
"Then let's ride over now, and you can
look at the place," said he; rising.
</p>

<p>
Harmer would not come, so I left him
with the sisters.  When we returned I was
the owner of the house, stable, two cows,
etc., and George Nettlebury was fighting
with Indian Alice, to whom he had
announced his intention of going East at once,
and without her.
</p>

<p>
"I'm tired of this life; it's quite
disgusting!" said George, as we departed.  "I'm
glad you came, Mr. Ticehurst, for I'm off too
quick."
</p>

<p>
As we rode back to Thomson Forks, Harmer
asked pathetically what he was to do.
</p>

<p>
"We must see, Jack," I answered kindly.
"We'll get you something in town."
</p>

<p>
"I'd rather be with you," he answered
dolorously.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you can't yet, that's certain," said I.
"I can't afford to pay you wages, when there
will be no more than I can get through
myself; when there is, I'll let you know.
In the meantime you must make money,
Jack.  There's a sawmill in town.  I know
the man that runs it&mdash;Bill Custer, and I'll
go and see him for you."
</p>

<p>
Jack sighed, and we rode on in silence
until we reached the Forks.
</p>

<p>
After we had had supper Jack and I were
standing in the barroom, not near the stove,
which was surrounded by a small crowd of
men, who smoked and chewed and chattered,
but close by the door for the sake of the
fresher air, when we saw Siwash Jim ride
up.  After tying his horse to the rail in
front of the house, to which half a dozen
other animals in various stages of equine
despondency or irritation were already
attached, he swaggered into the bar,
brushing against me rather rudely as he
did so.  Harmer's eyes flashed with indignation,
as if it was he who had been insulted.
But I am a very peaceable man, and don't
always fight at the first chance.  Besides,
being so much bigger than Jim, I could, I
considered, afford to take no notice of what
an ill-conditioned little ruffian like that did
when he was probably drunk.  Presently
Jack spoke to me.
</p>

<p>
"That beastly fellow keeps looking at you,
Mr. Ticehurst, as if he would like to cut
your throat.  What's wrong with him?  Is
he jealous of you, do you think?"
</p>

<p>
It was almost blasphemy to dream of such
a thing, and I looked at Mr. John Harmer
so sternly that he apologized; yet I believe
it must to some extent have been that which
caused the trouble that ensued almost
directly, and added afterward to the danger
in which I already stood.  I turned round
and looked at Jim, who returned my glance
furiously.  He ordered another drink, and
then another.  It seemed as if he was
desirous of making himself drunk.  Presently
Dave, who was, as usual, behind the bar,
spoke to him.
</p>

<p>
"Going back to the ranch to-night, Jim?"
</p>

<p>
Jim struck the bar hard with his fist.
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm not!  Never, unless I go to set
the damned place on fire!"
</p>

<p>
"Why, what's the matter?" asked Dave,
smiling, while Harmer and I pricked up our ears.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  I had some trouble with old Fleming
just now," said Jim, in a hoarse voice of
passion.  "He's like the rest, wants too much;
the more one does, the more one may do.
He's a dirty coyote, and his girls are&mdash;&mdash;"  And
the gentle-minded Jim used an epithet
which made both our ears tingle.
</p>

<p>
Jack made a spring, but I caught him by
the shoulder and sent him spinning back, and
walked up alongside the men.  I saw my
own face in the glass at the back of the bar;
it was very white, and I could hardly recognize it.
</p>

<p>
"Mind what you say, you infernal ruffian!"
I said, in a low voice, "or I'll break your neck
for you!  Don't you dare to speak about
ladies, you dog, or I'll strangle you!"  He
sprang back like lightning.  If he had had a
six-shooter on him I think my story would
have ended here, for I had none myself.  But
Jim had no weapon.  Yet he was no coward,
and did not "take water," or "back down,"
as they say there.  He steadied himself one
moment, and then threw the water-bottle at
me with all his force.  Though I ducked,
I did not quite escape it, for the handle
caught me on the forehead near the hair, and,
in breaking, cut a gash which sent the blood
down into my left eye.  But I caught hold
of him before he could do anything else.
In a moment the room was in an uproar;
some of the men climbed on to the tables
in order to get a view, while those outside
crowded to the door.  They roared, "Leave
'em alone!" when Dave attempted to
approach, and one big fellow caught hold
of Harmer and held him, saying at the same
time, as Jack told me afterward, "You stay
right here, sonny, and see 'em fight.  Mebbe
you'll larn something!"
</p>

<p>
I found Jim a much tougher customer than
I should have imagined, although I might
have handled him more easily if I had not
been for the time blind in one eye.  But he
was like a bunch of muscle; his arms, though
slender, were as tough and hard as his
stock-whip handle, and his quickness was surprising.
He struck me once or twice as we grappled,
and then we fell, rolling over and over, and
scattering the onlookers, as we went, until we
came against the legs of the table, which gave
way and sent three men to the floor with a
shock that shook the house.  Finally, Jim got
his hand in my hair and tried to gouge out
my eyes.  Fortunately, it was not long enough
for him to get a good hold, but when I felt
his thumbs feeling for my eyes, all the
strength and rage I ever had seemed to come
to me, and I rose suddenly with him clinging
to me.  For a moment we swayed about, and
then I caught his throat, pushed him at arm's
length from me, and, catching hold of his
belt, I threw him right over my head.  I was
standing with my back to the door, and he
went through it, fell on the sidewalk, and
rolled off into the road, where he lay
insensible.
</p>

<p>
"Very good!" said Dave; "very well
done indeed!  Pick him up, some of you
fellows, and see if he's dead.  The son of a
gun, I'll make him pay for that bottle,
and for the table!  Come, have a drink,
Mr. Ticehurst.  You look rather warm."
</p>

<p>
I should think I did, besides being
smothered with blood and dust.  I was glad
to accept his invitation.
</p>

<p>
"Is he dead?" I asked of Harmer, who
came in just then.
</p>

<p>
"Not he," said Jack, "he's coming to
already, but I guess he'll fight no more for a
few days.  That must have been a sickener.
By Jove! how strong you must be&mdash;he went
out of the door like a stone out of a sling.
Lucky he didn't hit the post."  And Harmer
chuckled loudly, and then went off with me
to wash away the blood, and bandage the
cut in my forehead.
</p>

<p>
When I left town in the morning I heard
that Jim was still in bed and likely to stay
there for some time.  And Harmer, who was
going to work with Bill Custer, promised to
let me know if he heard anything which was
of importance to me.
</p>

<p>
On my way out to my new property I met
its late owner and his Indian wife in their
ricketty wagon, drawn by the horse I had not
thought worth buying.  Nettlebury was
more than half drunk, although it was early
in the morning, and when he saw me coming
he rose up, waved his hand to me, bellowed,
"I'm a-goin' East, I am!" and, falling over
the seat backward, disappeared from view.
Alice reached out her hand and helped
her husband to regain his former position.
I came up alongside and reined in my horse.
</p>

<p>
He looked at me.
</p>

<p>
"Been fightin' already, hev you; or did you
get chucked off?  More likely you got
chucked&mdash;it takes an American to ride these
cay uses!" said he half scornfully.
</p>

<p>
"No," said I, "I wasn't chucked, and I
have been fighting.  Did you hear why
Siwash Jim left Fleming!"
</p>

<p>
"No, not exactly," he returned; "but he
was sassy with Miss Elsie, and&mdash;oh, I
dunno&mdash;but you hev been fightin', eh?  Did you
lick him&mdash;and who was it?"
</p>

<p>
"The man himself, Mr. Nettlebury," said
I&mdash;"Jim; and I reckon I did whip him."
</p>

<p>
He laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Good on you, old man!  He's been
wanting it this long while past; but look
out he don't put a knife in your ribs.  Now
then," said he ferociously, turning to his wife,
"why don't you drive on?  Here, catch
hold!" and giving her the reins, he lifted his
hand to strike her.  But just then the old
horse started up, he fell over the seat again,
and lay there on a pile of sacking.  I hardly
thought he would get East with his money,
and I was right, for I hired him to work for
me soon afterward.
</p>

<p>
When I came to the Flemings' there was
no one about but the old man.
</p>

<p>
"Busy!" said he, "you may bet I'm busy.
I sent that black ruffian off yesterday, and
I've got no one to help me.  What's the
matter with your head?"
</p>

<p>
When I told him, he laughed heartily, and
then shook my hand.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad you thrashed him, Tom," said
he; "I'd have done it myself yesterday if I
had been ten years younger.  When Elsie
wanted him to get some water, he growled
and said all klootchmen, as he calls
'em&mdash;women, you know&mdash;were alike, Indian or
white, and no good.  I told him to get out.
Is he badly hurt?"
</p>

<p>
"Not very," I answered.
</p>

<p>
"I hoped he was," said the old man.  "It's
a pity you didn't break his neck!  I would
as soon trust a black snake!  Are you going
over yonder?"
</p>

<p>
"I guess so," I answered; "I must get
the place cleaned up a bit&mdash;it's like a pigsty,
or what they call a hog-pen in this country,"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I guess it is," he replied; "but
come over in the evening, if you like."
</p>

<p>
I thanked him and rode off, happy in one
thing at least&mdash;I was near Elsie.  I felt as if
Harmer's suspicions about Mat were a mere
chimera, and that the lad in some excitement
had mistaken the dark face of some harmless
Indian for that of the revengeful Malay.
And as to Siwash Jim, why, I shrugged my
shoulders; I did not suppose he was so
murderously inclined as Nettlebury imagined.
It would be hard lines on me to have two
men so ill disposed toward me, through
no fault of my own, as to wish to kill me.
</p>

<p>
I went back to the Flemings' after a hard
day's work, in which I burnt, or otherwise
disposed of, an almost unparalleled collection
of rubbish, including old crockery and
bottles, dirty shirts and worn-out boots,
which had been accumulating indoors and
out for some ten years.  After being nearly
smothered, I was glad to go down to the
creek and take a bath in the clear, cold water
which ran into the main watercourse issuing,
some two miles away, from the Black Ca√±on
at the back of the valley, concerning which
Fleming had once spoken to me.  That
evening at his ranch was the pleasantest I
ever spent in my life up to that time, in spite
of the black cloud which hung over me, for
Fanny was as bright and happy as a bird,
while Elsie, who seemed to have come to her
senses, spoke almost freely, displaying no
more disinclination to me, even apparently,
than might naturally be set down to her
instinctive modesty, and her knowledge that
I was courting her, and desired to be
received as her lover.
</p>

<p>
I spoke to her late that evening when
Fleming went out to throw down the night's
hay to his horses.  For Fanny vanished
discreetly at the same moment, and continued
to make just enough noise in the kitchen to
assure us she was there, while it was not
sufficient to drown even the softest
conversation.  Good girl she was, and is&mdash;I
love her yet, though&mdash;well, perhaps I had
better leave that unsaid at present.
</p>

<p>
"Elsie," I said, when we were alone, "do
you remember what I said when we parted
on the steamer?"
</p>

<p>
She cast her eyes down, but did not answer.
</p>

<p>
"I think you do, Elsie," I went on; "I said
I should never forget.  Do you think I have?
Don't you know why I left my ship, why I
came to this country, why I went mining, and
why I have worked so hard and patiently for
long, long months without seeing you?  Answer
me; do you know why?"
</p>

<p>
She hesitated a moment, lifted up her blue
eyes, dropped them at the sight of the passion
in mine, and said gently, "I suppose so,
Mr. Ticehurst."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you know, Elsie; it was that I
might be near you, that I might get rich
enough to be able to claim you.  How
fortunate I have been in that!  But am I
fortunate in other things, too, Elsie?  Will you
answer me that, Elsie?"
</p>

<p>
I approached her, but she held up her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Stay, Mr. Ticehurst!&mdash;if I must speak.
I may have judged you wrongly, but I am
not wholly sure that I have.  If I have not,
I should only be preparing misery for myself
and for you, if I answered your questions as
you would have me.  I want time, and I must
have it, or some other assurance; for how can
I wholly trust you when you will not speak
as you might do?"
</p>

<p>
Ah! how could I?  But this was
far better than I had expected&mdash;far better.
</p>

<p>
"Elsie," I answered quietly, "I am ready
to give you time, all the time you need to
prove me, and my love for you, though there
is no need.  My heart is yours, and yours
only, ever from the time I saw you.  I have
never even wavered in my faith and hope.
But I do not care so long as I may be near
you&mdash;so long as I may see you sometimes,
and speak to you.  For without you I shall
be wretched, and would be glad even if that
wretched Malay were to kill me, as he threatened."
</p>

<p>
I thought I was cunning to bring in Matthias,
and indeed she lifted her eyes then.
But she showed no signs of fear for me.
Perhaps she looked at me, saying to herself
there was no need of such a strong man being
afraid of such a visionary danger.  She spoke
after a little silence.
</p>

<p>
"Then let it be so, Mr. Ticehurst.  If
what you say be true, there at least is nothing
for you to fear."
</p>

<p>
She looked at me straight then with her
glorious blue eyes, and I would have given
worlds to catch her in my arms and press her
to my heart.  She went on:
</p>

<p>
"And if you never give me cause, why&mdash;"  She
was silent, but held out her hand.
</p>

<p>
I took it, pressed it, and would have raised
it to my lips, only she drew it gently away.
But I went to rest happy that night.  Give
her cause!&mdash;indeed, what cause could I give
her?  That is what I asked myself, without
knowing what was coming, without feeling
my ignorance, my blindness, and my helplessness
in the strange web of fate and fated
crime which was being woven around me&mdash;without
being conscious, as an animal is in
the prairie, of that storm, so ready to burst
on my head, whose first faint clouds had risen
on the horizon of my life, even before I had
seen her, in the very hour that I had joined
the <i>Vancouver</i> under my own brother's
command.  I went to sleep, wondering vaguely
what had become of him.  But we are blind,
all of us, and see nothing until the curtain
rises on act after act; being ignorant still,
whether the end shall be sweet or bitter to
us, whether it shall justify our smiles in
happiness, or our tears in some bitter
tragedy.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
For two days I worked in and about my
house, putting things in some order, and on
the third I rode over to the Flemings' early
in the morning, as it had been arranged that
I was to go out with Mr. Fleming to look
after some cattle of his, which a neighbor
had complained of.  I never felt in better
spirits than when I rode over the short two
miles which separated us, for the morning
was calm and bright, with a touch of that
glorious freshness known only among mountains
or on high plateaus lifted up from the
common level of the under world.  I even
sang softly to myself, for the black cloud of
doubt, which but a few days ago had
obscured all my light, was driven away by a
new dawning of hope, and I was content and
without fear.  I shouted cheerfully for
Fleming as I rode up, and he came to the
door with his whip over his arm, followed by
the two girls.  I alighted, and shook hands
all round.
</p>

<p>
"Then you are ready, Mr. Fleming?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"When I have put the saddle on the black
horse," he replied, as he went toward the
stable, leaving me standing there, for I was
little inclined to offer to assist him while
Elsie remained outside the house.  Fanny
was quite as mischievous as ever, and
whether her sister had told her anything of
what had passed between us two days before
or not, she was evidently conscious that the
relations between Elsie and myself had
somehow altered for the better.
</p>

<p>
"How do you find yourself these days,
Tom?" she asked, with a merry twinkle in
her eye.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, Fanny," I answered.  "Thanks
for your inquiry."
</p>

<p>
"Does the climate suit you, then?  Or is
it the surroundings?"
</p>

<p>
"Both, my dear girl, as long as the sun
shines on us!" I replied, laughing, while
Elsie turned away with a smile.
</p>

<p>
Fanny almost winked at me, and then
looked up the road toward Thomson Forks,
which ran close by the ranch and led toward
an Indian settlement on the Lake about ten
miles away.
</p>

<p>
"There's someone coming," she said, "and
he's in a hurry.  Isn't he galloping, Mr. Ticehurst?"
</p>

<p>
I looked up the road and saw somebody
who certainly was coming down the long
slope from the crest of the hill with more
than reasonable rapidity.  I looked, and then
turned away carelessly.  What was the horseman
to me?  I leant against the post of the
veranda, which some former occupant of the
house had ornamented by whittling with his
knife, until it was almost too thin to do its
duty, and began to speak to Fanny again,
when I saw her blush and start.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Mr. Ticehurst," she said, "it's Mr. Harmer!"
</p>

<p>
Then the horseman was something to me,
after all.  For what but some urgent need
would bring Jack, who was entirely ignorant
of horses and riding, at that breakneck gallop
over the mountain road?  My carelessness
went suddenly, and I felt my heart begin to
beat with unaccustomed violence.  I turned
pale, I know, as I watched him coming
nearer.  I was quite unconscious that Elsie
had rejoined her sister, and stood behind me.
</p>

<p>
Harmer came closer and closer, and when
he saw us waved his hat.  In a moment he
was at the gate, while I stood still at the
house, and did not move to go toward him.
He alighted, opened the gate, and, with his
bridle over his aim, came up to us.  He said
good-morning to the girls hurriedly, and
turned to me.
</p>

<p>
"You must come to Thomson Forks
directly, Mr. Ticehurst!" he said, gasping,
wiping his forehead with his sleeve.
"Something's happened, I don't know
what, and I can't tell; but she wants to see
you at once, and sent me off to fetch you&mdash;and
so I came, and, oh! how sore I am," and
he wriggled suggestively, and in a way that
would have been comic under other circumstances.
</p>

<p>
I caught hold of his arm.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean," I roared, "you
young fool?  What's happened, and who
wants to see me?  Who's <i>she</i>?"
</p>

<p>
He looked up in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Why, didn't I say Mrs. Ticehurst, of course?"
</p>

<p>
I let him go and fell against the post,
making it crack as I did so.  I looked at
Elsie, and she was white and stern.  But she
did not avoid my eye.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what is it&mdash;what's happened?" I
said at last.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, I tell you, sir," said he
almost piteously; "all I know is that I was
sent for to the sawmill by Dave, and when I
came I saw Mrs. Ticehurst; and she's dressed
in black, sir, and she looked dreadfully bad,
and she just shook hands with me, and told
me to fetch you at once.  And when I asked
what for, she just stamped, sir, and told me
to go.  And so I came, and that's all!"
</p>

<p>
Surely it was enough.  Much as I liked
her, I would rather have met Mat or the very
devil in the way than had this happen now,
when things were going so well with me.
And in black?&mdash;good God! had anything
happened to my brother?  I turned white, I
know, and almost fell.
</p>

<p>
"You had better go at once, Tom,"
laid Fanny, who held me by the arm.  I
turned, I hardly know why, to her sister.
Her face was very pale, but her eyes
glittered, and she looked like marble.  I know
my own asked hers a question, but I got no
response.  I turned away toward my horse,
and then she spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Ticehurst, let me speak to you one
moment.  Fanny, go and talk to Mr. Harmer."
</p>

<p>
And Fanny and I both obeyed her like children.
</p>

<p>
She looked at me straight.
</p>

<p>
"How could I prove you, Mr. Ticehurst,"
she said, in a low voice, "was what I asked
the other night.  Now the means are in my
power.  What are you going to do?"
</p>

<p>
"I am going to the Forks," I said, in
bewilderment.  Her eyes flashed, and she
looked at me scornfully.
</p>

<p>
"Then go, but don't ever speak to me again!  Go!"
</p>

<p>
And she turned away.  I caught her arm.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be unjust, Elsie!&mdash;don't be cruelly
unjust!" I cried.  What a fool I was; I
knew she loved me, and yet I asked her
not to be cruel and unjust.  Can a woman
or a man in love be anything else?
</p>

<p>
"How can I stay away?" I asked
passionately, "when my brother's wife sends
for me?  And she is in black&mdash;poor Will
must be dead!"
</p>

<p>
If he was dead, then Helen was free.
I saw that and so did Elsie, and it hardened
her more than ever, for she did not answer.
</p>

<p>
"Look then, Elsie, I am going, and you say
I shall not speak to you again.  You are cruel,
very cruel&mdash;but I love you!  And you shall
speak to me&mdash;aye, and one day ask my pardon
for doubting me.  But even for you I cannot
refuse this request of my own sister-in-law&mdash;who
is ill, alone, in sorrow and trouble, in a
strange land.  For the present, good-by!"
</p>

<p>
I turned away, took my horse from the
fence, and rode off rapidly, without thinking
of Harmer, or of Fleming, who was standing
in amazement at his stable, as I saw when I
opened the swing-gate.  And if Harmer had
come up at a gallop, I went at one, until my
horse was covered with sweat, and the foam,
flying from his champed bit, hung about my
knees like sea-foam that did not easily melt.
In half an hour I was at Conlan's door, and
was received by Dave.  In two minutes I
stood in Helen's presence.
</p>

<p>
When I saw her last she had that rich red
complexion which showed the pure color of
the blood through a delicate skin; her eyes
were piercing and perhaps a little hard, and
her figure was full and beautiful.  She had
always rejoiced, too, in bright colors, such as
an Oriental might have chosen, and their
richness had suited her striking appearance.
But now she was woefully altered, and I
barely knew her.  The color had deserted
her cheeks, which were wan and hollow;
her eyes were sunken and ringed with dark
circles, and her bust had fallen in until she
looked like the ghost of her former self, a
ghost that was but a mere vague memory
of her whom I had first known in Melbourne.
</p>

<p>
Her dress, too, was black, which I knew
she hated, and in which she looked even less
like herself.  Her voice, when she spoke, no
longer rang out with assurance, but faltered
ever and again with the tears that rose to her
eyes and checked her utterance.
</p>

<p>
I took her hand, full of pity for her, and
dread of what she had to tell me, for it must
be something dreadful which had changed
her so much and brought her so far.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Helen?" I said, in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"What did I come for, you mean, Tom?"
she asked, though desiring no answer.  "I
came for your sake&mdash;and not for Will's.  I
thought you might never get a letter, and I
wanted to see you once again.  Ah! how
much I desired that.  Tom, you are in
danger!" she spoke that suddenly&mdash;"in
danger every moment!  For that man who
threatened your life&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
I nodded, sucking my dry lips, for I knew
what she meant, and I was only afraid of
what else she had to tell me.
</p>

<p>
"That man has escaped, and has not been
caught.  O Tom, be careful&mdash;be careful!
If you were to die, too&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, Helen?" I asked,
though I knew full well what she meant.
She looked at me.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you think?  Yes, you can perhaps
partly; but not all&mdash;not all the horror of it.
Tom, Will is dead!  And not only that, but
he was murdered in San Francisco!"
</p>

<p>
I staggered, and sat down staring at her.
She went on in a curiously constrained
voice.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; the very first night we came ashore,
and in our hotel!  He was intoxicated, and
came in late, and I wouldn't have him in my
room.  I made them put him in the next, and
I heard him shouting out of his window over
the veranda soon afterward, and then I fell
asleep.  And in the morning I found him&mdash;I
myself found him dead in bed, struck right
through with a stab in the heart.  And he
was robbed, too.  Tom, it nearly killed me,
it was so horrible&mdash;oh, it was horrible!  I
didn't know what to do.  I was going to
send for you, and then I read in the paper
about Mat having escaped two days before,
so I came away at once."
</p>

<p>
She ceased and sobbed violently; and I
kept silence.  God alone knows what was in
my heart, and how it came there; but for a
moment&mdash;yes, and for more than that&mdash;I
suspected her, his wife, of my brother's
murder!  I was blind enough, I suppose, and
so was she; but then so many times in life
we wonder suddenly at our want of sight
when the truth comes out.  I remembered
she had once said she hated him, and could
kill him.  And besides, she loved me.  I
shivered and was still silent.  She looked up
and caught my eye, which, I knew, was full
of doubt.  She rose up suddenly, came to
me, fell on her knees, and cried:
</p>

<p>
"No, no, Tom&mdash;not that!  For God's
sake, don't look at me so!"
</p>

<p>
And I knew she saw my very heart, and
I was ashamed of myself.  I lifted her up
and put her on a chair.  Heavens! how light
she was to what she had been, for her soul
had wasted her body away like a strong
wind fanning a fire.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Will!" I said at last, and then I
asked if she had remained for the inquest.
No, she had not, she answered.  I started at
her reply.  If I could think what I had,
what might others not do?  For her to
disappear like that after the murder of her
husband was enough to make people believe
her guilty of the crime, and I wondered that
she had not been prevented from leaving.
But on questioning her further, I learnt that
the police suspected a certain man who was
a frequenter of that very hotel; and, after
the manner of their kind, had got him in
custody, and were devoting all their
attention to proving him guilty of the crime,
whether there were <i>prima facie</i> proofs or
not.  Still, it seemed bitter that poor Will
should be left to strangers while his wife
came to see me; and though she had done it
to save me, as she thought, yet, after all, the
danger was hardly such as to warrant her
acting as she had done.  But I was not the
person to blame her.  She had done it, poor
woman, because she yet loved me, as I knew
even then.  But I saw, too, that it was love
without hope; and even if it had not been,
she must have learnt that I was near to
Elsie; and that I was "courting old
Fleming's gal" was the common talk whenever
my name was mentioned.  I tried to convince
myself that she had most likely ceased
to think of me, and I preferred to believe it
was only the daily and hourly irritation of
poor Will's conduct which had driven her to
compare me with him to his disadvantage.
Well, whatever his faults were, they had been
bitterly expiated; as, indeed, such faults as
his usually are.  It does not require statistics
to convince anyone who has seen much of
the world that most of the trouble in it
comes directly from drink.
</p>

<p>
I was in a strange situation as I sat
reflecting.  I suppose strict duty required me to
go to San Francisco, and yet Will would be
buried before I could get there.  Then what
was I to do with his widow?  She could not
stay there, I could not allow it, nor did I
think she desired it.  Still she was not fit to
travel in her state of nervous exhaustion;
indeed, it was a marvel that she had been able
to come so far, even under the stimulus of
such unwonted excitement.  I could not go
away with her even for a part of the return
journey, for I felt Elsie would be harder and
harder to manage the more she knew I saw
of Helen.  I ended by coming to the
conclusion that she must stay at the Forks for
a while, and that I must go back and try
to have an explanation with Elsie.  Helen
bowed her head in acquiescence when I told
her what she had better do, for the poor
woman was utterly broken down, and ready
to lean on any arm that was offered her; and
she, who had been so strong in her own will,
was at last content to be advised like an
obedient child.  I left her with Mrs. Conlan,
to whom I told as much as I thought desirable,
and, kissing her on the forehead, I took
my horse and rode slowly toward home.
</p>

<p>
As I left the town I saw Siwash Jim
sitting on the sidewalk, and he looked at
me with a face full of diabolical hatred.
When I got to the crest of the hill above the
town I turned in the saddle, and saw him
still gazing after me.
</p>

<p>
When half-way home I met Harmer, who
was riding even slower than I, and sitting as
gingerly in the saddle as if he were very
uncomfortable, as I had no doubt he was.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mr. Ticehurst," said he eagerly,
when we came near, "what was it?"
</p>

<p>
I told him, and he looked puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he remarked at last, "it seems to
me I must have been mistaken after all, and
that I didn't see Mat when I thought I did.
Let me see, when did he escape?"
</p>

<p>
I reckoned it up, and it was only twelve
days ago, for Helen had taken nine days
coming from San Francisco, according to what
she told me.
</p>

<p>
"Then it is impossible for me to have seen
him in New Westminster," said Harmer.
"But it is very strange that I should have
imagined I did see him, and that he did
escape after all."
</p>

<p>
Then I told him of my brother's death.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Mr. Ticehurst," he exclaimed,
"Matthias must have done it himself!  He
must&mdash;don't you see he must?"
</p>

<p>
The thought had not entered into my head.
</p>

<p>
"No," said I; "I don't see it at all.
There's a man in custody for it now, and it is
hardly likely Mat would stay in San
Francisco, if he escaped, for two days.
Besides, it is even less likely that he would
fall across my brother the very first evening
he came ashore."
</p>

<p>
Harmer shook his head obstinately.
</p>

<p>
"We shall see, sir&mdash;we shall see.  You
know he didn't like Captain Ticehurst much
better than you.  Then, you say he was
robbed of his papers.  Was your address
among them, do you think?"
</p>

<p>
I started, for Jack's suspicion seemed
possible after all.  The thing, looked more
likely than it had done at first sight.  And
yet it was only my cowardice that made me
think so.  I shook my head, but answered
"yes" to his question.
</p>

<p>
"Then pray, Mr. Ticehurst, be careful,"
said Jack earnestly, "and carry your revolver
always.  Besides, that fellow Jim is about
again.  You hardly hurt him at all; he must
be made of iron, and I heard last night he
threatened to have your life."
</p>

<p>
"Threatened men live long, Jack," said
I.  "I am not scared of him.  That's only
talk and blow.  I don't care much if Mat
doesn't get on my track.  He would be
dangerous.  Did you see Miss Fleming
before you left?" I said, turning the
conversation.
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.  She had gone to her
room, and remained there when I went away.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Harmer, I shall be in town the day
after to-morrow," I said at last, "and if
anything happens, you can send me word;
and go and see Mrs. Ticehurst meanwhile."
</p>

<p>
"I will do that," said he, "but to-morrow
morning I have to go up the lake to the
logging camp, and don't know when I shall
be back.  That's what Custer said this
morning, when I asked him to let me come
over here."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, it won't matter, I dare say," I
answered.  "Take care of yourself, Jack."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Ticehurst," said he, turning
round in the saddle, and wincing as he did
so, "it is you who must be careful!  Pray,
do be very careful!"
</p>

<p>
I nodded, shook hands, and rode on.
</p>

<p>
When I came to the Flemings', Fanny
was at the big gate, and she asked a question
by her eyes before we got close enough to
speak.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Fanny," said I, "it was serious."  And
then I told her what had occurred.
She held out her hand and pressed mine
sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
"I am so sorry, Tom," was all she said;
but she said it so kindly that her voice
almost brought the tears to my eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Has Elsie spoken to you since I went,
Fanny?" I asked, as we walked down to
the house together, while my horse followed
with his head hanging down.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't even seen her, Tom," she
replied; "the door was locked, and when I
knocked she told me to go away, which, as
it's my room too, was not very polite."
</p>

<p>
In spite of my love for Elsie, I felt
somewhat bitter against her injustice to me,
and I was glad to see that I made her suffer
a little on her part.  I know I have said very
little about my own feelings, for I don't care
somehow to put down all that I felt, any
more than I like to tell any stranger all that
is near my heart; but I did feel strongly and
deeply, and to see her, who was with me by
day and night as the object of my fondest
hope, so unjust, was enough to make me
bitter.  I wished to reproach her, for I was
not a child&mdash;a boy, to be fooled with like this.
</p>

<p>
"Go and ask her to see me, Fanny, please,"
I said rather sternly, as I stood outside the
door.  "And don't tell her anything of what
I told you, either of Will or Matthias."
</p>

<p>
Fanny started.
</p>

<p>
"You never said anything of Matthias!" she cried.
</p>

<p>
"Didn't I, Fanny?  Well, then, I will.
He has escaped from prison, and I suppose
he is after me by this.  But don't tell Elsie.
Just say I want to see her."
</p>

<p>
In a few moments she came back, with
tears in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"She won't, Tom!  She is in an obstinate
fit, I know.  And though she is crying her
eyes out&mdash;the spiteful cat!&mdash;she won't come.
I know her.  She just told me to go away.
What shall I do?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, Fanny," I answered; "you can
tell her what you like.  Will you be so cruel
to your lover, little Fanny?"
</p>

<p>
She looked up saucily.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, Tom; I shall see when I
have one"&mdash;and she laughed.
</p>

<p>
"What about Jack Harmer, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, you see," and she looked down,
"he's very young."  She wasn't more than
seventeen herself, and looked younger.
"And, besides, I don't care for anybody but
Elsie and father and you, Tom."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, Fanny," said I; "give me a
kiss from Elsie, and make her give it you
back."
</p>

<p>
"I will, Tom," she said quite simply, and,
kissing her, I rode off quietly across the flat
to my solitary home.

<h3>
PART V
<br /><br />
AT THE BLACK CA√ëON.
</h3>

<p>
Now, as far as I have gone in this story, I
have related nothing which I did not see or
hear myself, which is, as it seems to me, the
proper way to do it, provided nothing important
is left out.  But as I have learnt since
then what happened to other people, and
have pieced the story together in my mind,
I see it is necessary to depart from the rule I
have observed hitherto, if I don't want to
explain, after I have come to the end of the
whole history, what occurred before; and
that, I can see, would be a very clumsy way
of narrating any affair.  Now, what I am
going to tell I have on very good evidence, for
Dave at the Forks, and Conlan's stableman
told me part, and afterward, as will be seen,
I actually learnt something from Siwash Jim
himself, who here plays rather a curious and
important part.
</p>

<p>
It appears that the day after I was at the
Forks (which day I spent, by the way, with
Mr. Fleming, riding round the country,
returning afterward by the trail which led
from the Black Ca√±on down to my house)
Siwash Jim, who had to all appearance
recovered from the injuries, which, however,
were only bruises, that I had inflicted on him,
began to drink early in the morning.  He
had, so Dave says, quite an unnatural power
of keeping sober&mdash;and Dave himself can
drink more than any two men I am acquainted
with, unless it is Mac, my old partner, so he
ought to know.  And though Jim drank
hard, he did not become drunk, but only
abused me.  He called me all the names
from coyote upward and downward which
a British Columbian of any standing has at
his tongue's end, and when Jim had exhausted
the resources of the fertile American
language, he started in Siwash or Indian, in
which there are many choice terms of abuse.
But in spits of his openness, Dave says
it was quite evident he was dangerous, and
that I might really have been in peril at any
time of the day if I had come to town, for
Jim was deemed a bad character among his
companions, and had, so it was said, killed
one man at least, though he had never been
tried for it.  But though he sat all day in the
bar, using my name openly, he never made
a move till eight in the evening, when he
went out for awhile.
</p>

<p>
When he returned he was accompanied by
a thin dark man, wearing a slouch hat over
his eyes, whom Dave took to be a half-breed
of some kind, and they had drinks together,
for which the stranger paid, speaking in good
English, but not with a Western accent.
Then the two went to the other side of the
room.  What their conversation was, no one
knows exactly, nor did I ever learn; but
Dave, who was keeping his eye on Jim, says
that it seemed as if the stranger was trying
to persuade Jim to be quiet and stay where
he was, and from what occurred afterward
there is little doubt his supposition was
correct.  Moreover, my name undoubtedly
occurred in this conversation, for Dave heard
it, and the name of my ranch as well.  Soon
after that some men came in, and, in consequence
of his being busy, Dave did not see
Jim go out.  But Conlan's stableman says
Jim came to the stable with the stranger and
got his horse.  When asked where he was
going, he said for a ride, and would answer
no more questions.  And all the time the
strange man tried to persuade him not to go,
and to come and have another drink.  If Jim
had been flush of money there might have
been a motive for this, but as he was not,
there seemed then to be none beyond the
sudden and absurd fondness that men
sometimes conceive for each other when drunk.
But if this were the case, it was only on the
stranger's side, for when the horse was brought
round to the door Jim mounted it, and when
the other man still importuned him not to go,
Siwash Jim struck at him with his left hand
and knocked off his hat as he stood in the
light coming from the bar.  And just then
attention was drawn from Jim by a sudden
shriek from the other side of the road where
Conlan's private house stood.  When Dave
came out and looked for him again, both he
and the other man had disappeared down the
road, which branched about half a mile out
of town into two forks, one leading eastward
and the other southward to the Flemings'.
</p>

<p>
Now, as I said before, most of that day I
had been out riding with Mr. Fleming, who
left me early, in order to go to the next ranch
down the road, and I had told him the whole
story about Mat's escape, and my brother's
death; which he agreed with me were hardly
likely to be connected.  Yet he acknowledged
if they were I was in much more danger than
one would have thought before, because such
a deed would show the Malay was a desperado
of the most fearless and dangerous
description; and besides, if he had robbed Will,
it was more than likely he knew where I was
from my own letters, or from my address
written in a pocketbook my brother always
carried, and which was missing.  Of course,
this conversation made me full, as it were, of
Mat; and that, combined with the unlucky
turn affairs had taken with regard to Elsie,
made me more nervous than I was inclined
to acknowledge to her father.  So before I
went to bed, which I did at ten o'clock&mdash;for I
was very tired, being still unaccustomed to
much riding&mdash;I locked my door carefully, and
put the table against it, neither of which
things I had ever done before, and which I
was almost inclined to undo at once, for it
seemed cowardly to me.  Yet I thought of
Elsie, and, still hoping to win her, I was
careful of my life.  I went to sleep, in spite of
my nervous preoccupation, almost as soon as
I lay down, and I suppose I must have been
asleep two hours before I woke out of a
horrible dream.  I thought that I was on board
ship, in my own berth, lying in the bunk, and
that Mat was on my chest strangling me with
his long lithe fingers.  And all the time I
heard, as I thought, the sails flap, as though
the vessel had come up in the wind.  As I
struggled&mdash;and I did struggle desperately&mdash;the
blood seemed to go up into my head and
eyes, until I saw the fiend's face in a red
light, and then I woke.  The house was on
fire, and I was being suffocated!  As the
flames worked in from the outside, and made
the scorching timbers crack again and again,
I sprang out of bed.  I had lain down with
my trousers on, and, seeing at once there
must be foul play for the house to catch fire
on the outside, and at the back too, where I
never went, I drew on my boots, snatched my
revolver up, and leapt at the front window,
through which I went with a crash, uttering
a loud cry as I did so, for a piece of the glass
cut my left arm deeply.  As I came to the
ground, I saw a horseman in front of me, and
by the light of the fire, which had already
mounted to the roof of the house, I recognized
Siwash Jim.  Then, whether it was that the
horse he rode was frightened at the crash I
made or not, it suddenly bounded into the
air, turned sharp round, and bolted into the
brush, just where the trail came down from
the Black Ca√±on.  As Jim disappeared, I
fired, but with no effect; and that my shot was
neither returned nor anticipated was, I saw,
due to the fact that the villain had dropped
his own six-shooter, probably at the first
bound of his horse, just where he had been standing.
</p>

<p>
I was in a blind fury of rage, for such a
cowardly and treacherous attack on an
unoffending man's life seemed hardly credible
to me.  And there my home was burning,
and it was no fault of his that I was not
burning with it, or shot dead outside my own
door.  But he should not escape, if I chased
him for a month.  I was glad he had been
forced to take the trail, for there was no
possible outlet to it for miles, so thick was the
brush in that mountainous region.  Fortunately,
I now had two horses; and the one in
my stable, which I had only bought from
Fleming a week before, was not the one I
had been riding all that day.  I threw the
saddle on him, clinched it up tightly, and led
him out.  I carried both the weapons, my
own and Jim's, and I rode up the narrow and
winding path in a blind and desperate fury,
which seldom comes to a man, but it when it
does it makes him careless of his own life
and utterly reckless; and as I rode, in a
fashion I had never done before, even though
I trusted a mountain-bred and forest-trained
horse, I swore that I myself should die that
night, or that Siwash Jim should feel the just
weight of my wrath.  But before I can tell
the terrible story of that terrible night I must
return once more, and for the last time, to
Thomson Forks.
</p>

<p>
I said, some pages back, that attention had
been drawn from Siwash Jim and his strange
companion by a sudden shriek from Ned
Conlan's house.  That shriek had been uttered
by Helen, who was still staying with Mrs. Conlan,
as she and her hostess were standing
outside in the dying twilight, and, after
screaming, she had fainted, remaining
insensible for nearly half an hour.  When
Dr. Smith, as he called himself&mdash;though an
Englishman has natural doubts as to how
the practitioners in the West earn their
diplomas&mdash;had helped her recovery, she spoke
at once in a state of nervous excitement
painful to witness.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I saw him&mdash;I saw him!" she said, in
an hysterical voice.
</p>

<p>
"Who, my dear?" asked Mrs. Conlan, in
what people call a comforting way.
</p>

<p>
"Where is Mr Conlan?" was Helen's
answer.  He came into the room in which
she was lying.  Helen turned to him at once.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Conlan, I want you to take me out to
my brother-in-law's house&mdash;to Mr. Ticehurst's
farm!"
</p>

<p>
They all exclaimed against her foolishness
and demanded why; while Conlan scratched
his head in a puzzled manner.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you I must see him to-night, and at
once!  For I saw the man who swore to kill him."
</p>

<p>
The bystanders shook their heads sagely,
thinking she was mad, but Conlan asked if
she meant Siwash Jim.
</p>

<p>
"No," she said, "it was not Jim."  But
she must go, and she would.  With an extraordinary
exhibition of strength, she rose and
ordered horses in an imperative tone, saying
she was quite well enough to do as she liked.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Conlan appealed to the doctor, and
he, perhaps being glad to advise against the
opinion of those present, as such a course
might indicate his superior knowledge, said
he thought it best to let her have her own
way.  I think, too, that Helen, who seemed
to have regained her strength, had regained
with it her old power of making people do as
she wished.  At any rate, Mr. Conlan meekly
acquiesced, and, saying he would drive her
himself, went out to order horses at once.
When the buggy was brought to the door,
Helen got up without assistance, and begged
him to be quick.  His wife, who would never
have dared to even suggest his hurrying,
stood aghast at seeing her usually masterful
husband do as he was bid.  They drove
off, leaving Mrs. Conlan to prophesy certain
death as the result of this inexplicable
expedition, while the others speculated, more or
less wildly, as to what it all meant.
</p>

<p>
Conlan told me that Helen never spoke all
the way except to ask how much longer they
were going to be, or to complain of the
slowness of the pace.
</p>

<p>
"Most women," said Ned, "would have
been scared at the way I drove, for it was
pitch dark; and if the horses hadn't known
the road as well, or better, than I did, we
should have come to grief in the first mile.
But she never turned a hair.  She was a
wonderful woman, sir!"
</p>

<p>
It was already past eleven o'clock when
they got to the top of the hill just above
Fleming's, and from there the light of my
house burning could be distinctly seen,
although the place itself was hidden by a
rise, and Helen pointed to it, nervously
demanding what it was.
</p>

<p>
"Ticehurst must have been burning
brush," said Conlan, offering the very
likeliest explanation.  But Helen said, "No, no,"
impatiently, and told him to hurry.  Just
then Conlan remembered that he did not
know the road across from Fleming's to my
place, and said so.
</p>

<p>
"You had better stop at Fleming's, and
send for him.  They aint in bed yet, ma'am.
I see their light."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to see the Flemings; I
want Mr. Ticehurst," said Helen obstinately.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we must stop at Fleming's," said
Conlan, "if it's only to ask the way.  I don't
know the road, and I'm not going to kill you
and myself by driving into the creek such a
night as this."
</p>

<p>
And Helen was fain to acquiesce, for she
could not do otherwise.
</p>

<p>
When they reached the house Fanny was
standing outside, and as the light from the
open door fell on Helen's pallid face, she
screamed.
</p>

<p>
"Good Heavens, Mrs. Ticehurst!  Is it
you?" she cried&mdash;"and you, Mr. Conlan?
Oh, I am so glad!&mdash;father's away, and
Mr. Ticehurst's house must be on fire."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said Helen, "I thought so.  Oh,
oh! he's dead, I know he's dead!  I must go
to him!  Fanny, dear, can you show us the
way&mdash;can you?  You must!  Perhaps we
can save him yet!"
</p>

<p>
She frightened Fanny terribly, for her face
was so pale and her eyes glittered so, and for
a moment the girl could hardly speak.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know it by night, Mrs. Ticehurst;
but Elsie does," she said at last.
</p>

<p>
"Where is she, then?" said Helen eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"She's gone over there now," cried Fanny,
"for father had not come home; and when
we saw the fire, we were afraid something
had happened, so Elsie took the black horse
and went over.  She's there now."
</p>

<p>
"Then what shall we do?" cried Helen, in
an agony, "he will be killed!"
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Mrs. Ticehurst?" asked
Fanny, trembling all over.  "Oh, what is it!"
</p>

<p>
But she took no notice and sat like a
statue, only she breathed hard and heavily,
and her hands twitched; as she looked
toward my burning home.
</p>

<p>
"Silence!" she cried suddenly, though
no one spoke.  "There is somebody coming."
</p>

<p>
And the three of them looked into the
darkness, in which there was a white figure
moving rapidly.
</p>

<p>
"It is Elsie!" screamed Fanny joyfully;
and Helen sprang from the buggy, and stood
in the light, as Elsie exclaimed in wonder at
Fanny's excited voice.
</p>

<p>
The two women stood face to face, looking
in each other's eyes, and then Elsie, who for
one moment had shown nothing but surprise,
went white with scorn and anger.  How glad
I should have been to have seen her so, or to
have learnt, even at that moment when I
stood in the greatest peril I have ever known,
that she had ridden over to save or help me,
even though her acts but added a greater
danger to those in which I already stood.
For her deed and her look were the deed and
look of a woman who loves and is jealous.
But it might have seemed to me, had I been
there, that Helen's coming had overbalanced
the scale once more against me, and perhaps
for the last time.  I am glad I did not know
that fear until it was only imagination, and
the imaginary canceling of a series of
events, that could place me again in such a
situation.
</p>

<p>
The two women looked at each other, and
then Elsie turned away.
</p>

<p>
"Stop, stop!" cried Helen; "what has
happened?  Where is Mr. Ticehurst?"
</p>

<p>
"What is that to you?" said Elsie cruelly,
and with her eyes flaming.
</p>

<p>
"Tell us, Elsie," said Fanny imploringly.
</p>

<p>
"I will <i>not</i>!" said her sister&mdash;"not to this
woman!  Go back, Mrs. Ticehurst!  What
are you doing here?"
</p>

<p>
Helen caught her by the arm, and looked
in her face.
</p>

<p>
"Girl, I know your thoughts!" she said;
"but you are wrong&mdash;I tell you, you are
wrong!  You love him&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I do not!" said Elsie angrily.  "I love
no other woman's lover!"
</p>

<p>
Surely, though there were two dazed onlookers,
these women were in a state to speak
their natural minds.
</p>

<p>
"Girl, girl!" said Helen, once more, "I
tell you again, you are wrong!  You are
endangering <i>your</i> lover's life.  Is he not your
lover, or did you go over there to find out
nothing?  I tell you, I came to save him,
and to save him for you&mdash;no, not for you, you
are not worth it, though he thinks you
perfection!  You are a wicked girl, and a
fool!  Come, come! why don't you speak?
What has become of him?  Is he over there now?"
</p>

<p>
Elsie was silent, but yielding.  Fanny
spoke again.
</p>

<p>
"Elsie&mdash;Elsie, speak&mdash;answer her!  What
happened over there, and where is the horse?"
</p>

<p>
Elsie turned to her, as though disdaining
to answer Helen.
</p>

<p>
"Someone set his house on fire, I think;
perhaps it was Jim, and Mr. Ticehurst has
gone after him!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said Helen, as if relieved, "if that
is all!  How did you know he is gone&mdash;did
you see him, speak to him?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Elsie; "I did not!"
</p>

<p>
"Then how do you know?" cried Fanny
and Helen, together.
</p>

<p>
"There was a man there&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Helen cried out as if she were struck, and
Elsie paused.
</p>

<p>
"Go on!" the other cried&mdash;"go on!"
</p>

<p>
"And when I came up he was sitting by
the house.  I asked him if Mr. Ticehurst was
there&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you fool!" groaned Helen, but only
Fanny heard it.
</p>

<p>
"And he got up," continued Elsie, "and
said there was no one there, but just as he
was coming from his camp to see what the
fire was, he heard a shot, and when he got to
the house he saw somebody just disappear
up the trail toward the ca√±on."
</p>

<p>
"Did you know him?" said Helen, as Elsie
paused to take breath, for when she began to
speak she spoke rapidly, and, conceal it as
she would, it was evident she was in a fearful
state of excitement.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Elsie; "but I think I have seen
him before."
</p>

<p>
"Where is he, then?" cried Helen, holding
her hand to her heart.  "Is he there still?"
</p>

<p>
"No," cried Fanny, almost joyfully, "you
gave him your horse to go and find Tom, and
help him, didn't you, Elsie?"
</p>

<p>
And Helen screamed out in a terrible
voice, "No, no! you did not, you did
not&mdash;say you did not, girl!"
</p>

<p>
Elsie, who had turned whiter and whiter,
turned to her suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I did," she cried; "I did give him
the horse."
</p>

<p>
Helen lifted her hands up over her head
with an awful gesture of despair, and fell on
her knees, catching hold of both the girls'
dresses.  But she held up and spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you wretched, unhappy girl!" she
cried.  "What have you done&mdash;what <i>have</i>
you done?  To whom did you give the horse?
I know, I know!  I saw him this very
night&mdash;the man who swore to be revenged on him
if it were after a century.  The man who
nearly killed him once, and who has escaped
from prison.  You have given him the means
of killing your lover&mdash;you have given Tom
Ticehurst up to Matthias, to a murderer&mdash;a
murderer!"
</p>

<p>
And she fell back, and this time did not
recover herself, but lay insensible, still holding
the girls' dresses with as desperate a clutch
as though she were keeping back from following
me the man who was upon my track that
terrible midnight.  But Elsie stooped, freed
her dress, and saying to Fanny, "See to her&mdash;see
to her!" ran down to the stable again,
just as her father rode through the higher gate.
</p>

<p>
And as that girl, who had known
and ridden from her childhood, was saddling
the first one she came to in the stable, I was
riding hard and desperately in the dark
not a quarter of a mile behind Siwash Jim.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The trail upon which we both were ran
from my house, straight up into the mountains
for nearly ten miles, and then followed the
verge of the Black Ca√±on for more than a
mile farther.  When I came up to that place
I stayed for one moment, and heard the dull
and sullen roar of the broken waters three
hundred feet beneath me, and then I rode on
again as though I was as irresistibly impelled
as they were, and was just as bound to cut
my way through what Fate had placed
before as they had been to carve that narrow
and tremendous chasm in the living rock.
And at last I came to a fork in the trail.
If I had not been there before with
Mr. Fleming, I should most likely have never
seen Jim that night, perhaps never again.
But we had stayed at that very spot.  The
left-hand fork was the main track, and led
right over the mountains into the Nicola
Valley; while the left and disused one, which
was partially obliterated by thick-growing
weeds, led back through the impassable scrub
and rough rocks to the middle of the Black
Ca√±on.  I had passed that end of it without
thinking, for indeed it was scarcely likely he
would have turned off there.  The chances
seemed a thousand to one that Jim would
take the left-hand path, but just because it
did seem so certain, I alighted from my horse
and struck a light.  The latest horse track
led to the right hand!  He had relied on my
taking the widest path, and continuing in it
until it was too late to catch a man who had
so skillfully doubled on me.  I had no doubt
that his curses at losing his revolver were
changed into chuckles, as he thought of me
riding headlong in the night, until my horse
was exhausted, while he was returning the
way I had come.  I stopped to think, and
then, getting on my horse, I rode back slowly
to where the trails joined at the edge of the
Ca√±on.  I would wait for him there.  And I
waited more than half an hour.
</p>

<p>
It is strange how such little circumstances
alter everything, for not only would Jim's
following the Nicola trail have resulted in
something very different, but, waiting half an
hour, during which I cooled somewhat and
lost the first blind rage of passion in which I
had set out, set me reflecting as to what I
should do.  If I had come up with him at
full gallop I should have shot him there and
then.  He would have expected it, and it
would have been just vengeance; but now I
was quietly waiting for him, and to shoot
him when he appeared seemed to me hardly
less cowardly conduct than his own.  Then,
if I gave him warning, he would probably
escape me, and I was not so generous as to
let him have the chance.  Yet, in after years,
seeing all that followed from what I did, I
think I was more generous than just.  I ought
to have regarded myself as the avenging arm
of the law, and have struck as coolly as an
executioner.  But I determined to give him
a chance for his life, though giving him that
was risking my own, which I held dear, if
only for Elsie's sake; and so I backed my
horse into the brush, where I commanded
both trails, and, cocking both revolvers, I sat
waiting.  In half an hour I heard the tramp
of a horse, though at first I could not tell
from which way the sound came.  But at
last I saw that I had been right in my
conjecture, and that my enemy was given into
my hands.  My heart beat fast, but my
hands were steady, for I had full command
over myself.  I waited until he was nearly
alongside of me, and then I spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Throw up your hands, Siwash Jim!" I
said, in a voice that rang out over the roar
of the waters below us, "or you are a dead man!"
</p>

<p>
And he threw them up, and as he sat there
I could see his horse was wearied out.  If it
had not been, perhaps my voice would have
startled it, and compelled me to fire.
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do?" said he,
sullenly peering in my direction, for he could
barely see me against my background of trees
and brush, whereas I had him against the sky.
</p>

<p>
"I will tell you, you miserable scoundrel!"
I answered.  "But first, get off your horse,
and do it slowly, or I will put two bullets
through you!  Mind me!"
</p>

<p>
He dismounted slowly.
</p>

<p>
"Tie your horse to that sapling, if you will
be kind enough," I said further; "and don't
be in a hurry about it, and don't attempt to
get behind it, or you know what will happen."
</p>

<p>
When he had done as I ordered, I spoke again.
</p>

<p>
"Have you got any matches?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he replied.
</p>

<p>
"Of course you have, you villain!  The
same you set my house on fire with.  Well,
now rake up some brush, and make a little
fire here."
</p>

<p>
"What for?" said he quickly, for I believe
he thought for a moment I meant to roast
him alive.  I undeceived him if that was his idea.
</p>

<p>
"So that we can see each other," I replied,
"for I'm going to give you a chance for your
life, though you don't deserve it.  Where's
your six-shooter?"
</p>

<p>
"I dropped it," he grunted.
</p>

<p>
"And I picked it up," said I.  "So make
haste if you don't want to be killed with
your own weapon!"
</p>

<p>
What his thoughts were I can't say, but
without more words he set about making a
fire, soon having a vigorous blaze, by which I
saw plainly enough the looks of fear, distrust,
and hatred he cast at me.  But he piled on
the branches, though I checked him once or
twice when I thought he was going too far
to gather them.  When there was sufficient
light to illuminate the whole space about us
and the opposing bank of the ca√±on, I told
him that was enough.
</p>

<p>
"That will do," I said; "go and stand at
the edge of the ca√±on!"
</p>

<p>
He hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"You're not going to shoot me like a dog,
and put me down there, are you?" said he,
trembling.
</p>

<p>
"Like a dog?" said I passionately; "did
you not try to smother me like a bear in his
den, to burn me alive in my own house?  Do
as I tell you, or I'll shoot you now and roll
your body in the river!  Go!"
</p>

<p>
And he went as I asked him.
</p>

<p>
"Have you got any cartridges?" I demanded.
</p>

<p>
He pointed to his belt, and growled that
he had plenty.
</p>

<p>
"Then stay there, and I will tell you
what I will do with you.  I am going to
empty your revolver, and you can have it
when it is empty.  I will get off my horse
and then you can load it again, and when I
see you have filled it, you can do your best
for yourself.  Do you hear me?"
</p>

<p>
He nodded his head, and kept his eyes
fixed on me anxiously, as though not
daring to hope I was going to be so foolish
as my word.  But I was, even to the
extent of firing his revolver into the air,
though I had no suspicion of what I was
really doing, nor what such an act would
bring about.
</p>

<p>
I alighted from my horse, and let him go,
for there was no danger of his running away.
I even struck him lightly, and sent him up
the trail out of the way of accident; and then,
keeping my own revolver pointed at Jim, who
stood like a statue, I raised his in my left
hand.  I fired, and the reports rang out over
the hills.  I threw Siwash Jim his weapon,
saying:
</p>

<p>
"Load the chambers slowly, and count as
you do so."
</p>

<p>
What a fool I was, to be sure, not to have
shot him dead and let him lie!  Though I
should not have been free from the dangers
that encompassed me, yet they would have
been fewer, far fewer, and more easily
contended with.  But I acted as Fate would
have, and even as I counted I heard Jim
count too, in a strained, hoarse voice&mdash;one,
two, three, four, five, six&mdash;and he was an
armed man again, armed in the light, almost
half-way between us, that glittered in his
eyes and fell on my face.  And it was his life
or mine; his life that was worth nothing, and
mine that was precious with the possibilities
of love that I yet knew not, of love that was
hurrying toward me even then, side by side
with hate and death.
</p>

<p>
When Jim's weapon was loaded, he turned
toward me with the barrel pointed to the
ground.  His eyes were fixed on mine, fixed
with a look of fear and hatred, but hatred
now predominated.  I lowered my own
revolver until we both stood on equal terms.
</p>

<p>
"Look," said I sternly; "you see that
burning branch above the fire.  It is already
half burnt through; when it falls, look out
for yourself."
</p>

<p>
And he stood still, perfectly still, while
behind and under him the flood in the ca√±on
fretted and roared menacingly, angrily,
hungrily, and the sappy branch cracked and
cracked again.  It was bending, bending
slowly, but not yet falling, when Jim threw
his weapon up and fired, treacherous to the
last.  But his aim was not sure, no surer
than mine when I returned his shot.  As we
both fired again, I felt a sting in my left
shoulder, and the branch fell, slowly,
slowly&mdash;ah! as slowly as Jim did, for he sank on his
knees, rolled over sideways, and slipped backward
on the verge of the ca√±on, its sloping,
treacherous verge.  And as he slipped, he
caught a long root disclosed by the falling
earth, and with the last strength of life hung
on to it, a yard below me; as I ran to the
edge, and stopped there, horror-struck.  My
desire for vengeance was satisfied, more than
satisfied, for if I could have restored him to
solid ground and life I would have done it,
and bidden him go his way, so that I saw
him no more.  For his face was ghastly and
horrible to see; his lips disclosed his teeth
as he breathed through them convulsively,
and his nostrils were widely distended.  I
knelt down and vainly reached out my hands.
But he was a yard below me, and to go half
that distance meant death for me as well.  I
knelt there and saw him fail gradually; his
eyes closed and opened again and again; he
caught his lower lip between his teeth and
bit it through and through, and then his
head fell back, his hands relaxed, and he was
gone.  And I heard the sullen plunge of his
body as it fell three hundred feet into the
waters below.  I remained still and
motionless for a moment.  What a thing man was
that he should do such deeds!  I rose, and a
feeling of sorrow and remorse for this
terrible death of a fellow-creature made me
stagger.  I put my hand to my brow, and
then peered over the edge of the ca√±on.
What was I looking for?  Was I looking
into the river of Fate?  I took my revolver
and threw it into the ca√±on, that it should
slay no other man.  As it fell it struck a
projecting rock, and, exploding, the echoes in
the narrow space roared and thundered up
the gorge toward the east, where, just beyond
the mountains, the first faint signs of rosy
dawn were written upon the heavens.  Was
that an omen of peace and love to me, of a
fairer, brighter day?  I lifted my heart
above and prayed it might be so.  But it was
yet night, still dark, and the darkest hour is
before the dawn, for as I turned my back to
the ca√±on and stepped across to the fire which
had lighted poor, foolish, ignorant Jim to his
death, I looked up, and saw before me the
thin face I feared more than all others, and
the wicked eyes of my escaped enemy,
Matthias of the <i>Vancouver</i>.
</p>

<p>
I have never believed myself a coward, for
I have faced death too often, and but a few
minutes ago I had risked my life in a manner
which few men would have imitated; but
I confess that in the horrible surprise of
that moment, in the strange unexpectedness
of this sudden and most unlooked-for
appearance, I was stricken dumb and motionless,
and stood glaring at him with opened eyes,
while my heart's blood ran cold, For I was
unarmed, by my own act of revulsion and
remorse; and wounded too, for I could feel
the blood trickle slowly from my shoulder
that had been deeply scored by the second
bullet from Jim's revolver.  And I was in
the same position that I had put him in, in a
clear space with thick brush on both sides,
through which there was no escape, and in
which there was no shelter but a single tree
to the left of the blazing fire, which was
already gradually crawling in the dry brush.
Surely I was delivered into my enemy's hands,
for he was armed and carried a revolver,
on whose bright barrel the fire glinted
harshly.  How long we stood facing each
other I cannot say, but it seemed hours.  If
he had but fired then, he might have killed
me at once, for I was unable to move; but
he did not desire that, I could see he did not,
as his hot eyes devoured me and gleamed
with a light of savage joy and triumph.  He
spoke at last, and in a curiously quiet voice,
that was checked every now and again with
a sort of sob which made me shiver.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Mr. Ticehurst," he said slowly, "you
know me?  You look as if you did.  I am
glad you feel like that.  You are afraid!"
</p>

<p>
I looked at him and answered:
</p>

<p>
"It is a lie!"
</p>

<p>
And from that time forward it was a lie,
for I feared no more.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said, "I think not; you are pale,
and just now you shook.  I don't shake, even
after what I have been through.  Look at me!"
</p>

<p>
He pointed his weapon at me, and his
hand was as steady as a rock.  He lowered it
again and stroked the barrel softly with his
lean left hand.
</p>

<p>
"You remember what I said to you," he
went on, "don't you, Thomas Ticehurst?  I
do, and I have kept my word.  Ah!  I have
thought of this many times, many times.
They tortured me and treated me like a dog
in the jail you sent me to; they beat me,
and kicked me, and starved me, but I never
complained, lest my time there should be
longer.  And when I lay down at night I
thought of the time when I should kill you.
I knew it would come, and it has.  But just
now, when I saw you by the side of your
own grave, looking down, I didn't know
whether it was you or the other man, and I
thought perhaps he had killed you.  If it
had been he, I would have killed him."
</p>

<p>
He paused, and I still stood there with
a flood of thoughts rushing through me.
What should I do?  If he had taken his eyes
off mine for but one single moment I would
have sprung on him; but he did not, and
while he talked, I heard the horses champing
their bits in the brush.  And cruelest of all,
my own horse moved, and put his head
through the branches and looked at me.
Oh, if I were only on his back!  But I did
not speak.
</p>

<p>
"How shall I kill you?" said Matthias
at last; "I would like to cut you to pieces!"
</p>

<p>
He paused again, and then another horse
that I had not yet seen moved on the other
side of the trail where he had come up.  It
had heard the others, and I knew it must be
the animal he had ridden.  It came out of
the brush into the light of the fire, and I
knew it was Elsie's.  My heart gave a
tremendous leap, and then stood still.  How had
he become possessed of it?  I spoke, and in a
voice I could not recognize as my own, so
hoarse and terrible it was.
</p>

<p>
"How did you get that white horse, you
villain?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
He looked at me fiercely without at first
seeing how he could burt me, and then a look
of beast-like, cruel cunning came into his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said he, "I knew her!  It was
your girl's horse!  How did I get it?
Perhaps you would like to know?  You will
never see her again&mdash;never!  Where is she
now&mdash;where?"
</p>

<p>
He knew as little as I did, but the way he
spoke, and the horrible things he put into his
voice, made me boil with fury.
</p>

<p>
"You are a lying dog!" I cried, though
he had said nothing that I should be so
wrathful.  He grinned diabolically, seeing
how he had hurt me, and then laughed loud
in an insulting, triumphant manner.  It was
too much, and I made one tremendous bound
across the fire, and landed within three feet
of him.  He fired at the same moment, and
whether he had wounded me or not I did
not know; but the revolver went spinning
two yards off, and we grappled in a death-hug.
</p>

<p>
I have said that Siwash Jim was a hard
man to beat, but whether it was that I was
weak with my wound or not, I found Matthias,
who was mad with hate and fury, the
most terrible antagonist I had ever tackled.
He was as slippery as an eel, as lithe as a
snake, and withal his grip was like that of
a steel trap.  Yet if I could but prevent him
drawing his knife, which was at his belt, I
did not care.  I was his match if not in
agility, at least in strength, and I would
never let him go.  We were for one moment
still, after we grappled, and I trust I shall
never see anything that looks more like a
devil than his eyes, in which the light of the
fire shone, while he gnashed his teeth and
ground them until the foam and saliva oozed
out of his mouth like a mad dog's venom.
His forehead was seamed and wrinkled, his
cheeks were sucked in and then blown out
convulsively, and his whole aspect was more
hideous than that of a beast of prey.  And
then the struggle began.
</p>

<p>
At first it was a trial of strength, for
although I was so much the bigger, he knew
his own power and the force of his iron
nerves, and he hoped to overcome me thus.
We reeled to and fro, and twice went
through the fire, where I once held him for
an instant with a malicious joy that was
short-lived, for the pain added to his
strength, and he forced me backward, until
I struck the trunk of the tree a heavy blow.
Then we swayed hither and thither, for I
had him by the right wrist and the left
shoulder, not daring to alter my grip on his
right hand, lest he should get his knife.  He
held me in the same way, and at last we
came to the very verge of the ca√±on, and
spurned the tracks that Jim had made in his
agony.  For a moment I thought he would
throw us both in, but he had not lost hope.
If he had, that moment would have been my
last.  In another second we had staggered to
the fire, and he tried all his strength to free
his right hand.  At last, by a sudden wrench
he did it, and dropped his fingers like lightning
on his knife, just as I bent his left wrist
over, and struck him in the face with his
own clenched hand.  We both went down;
his knife ripped my shoulder by the very
place that Jim's bullet had struck, and we
rolled over and over madly and blindly,
burning ourselves on the scattered embers,
tearing ourselves on the jagged roots and
small branches, which we smashed, as I
strove to dash him on the ground, and he
struggled to free his arm, which I had
gripped above the elbow, to end the battle at
one blow.  But though he once drove the
point more than an inch into the biceps, and
three times cut me deeply, he did not injure
any nerve so as to paralyse the limb.  And
yet I felt that I was becoming insensible, so
tremendous was the strain and the excitement,
and I felt that I must make a last
effort, or die.  Somehow we rose to our
knees, still grappling, and if I looked a tithe
as horrible as he did, covered with blood,
saliva, and sweat, I must have been horrible
to see.  We glared in each other's eyes for one
moment, and then, loosing my hold on his
left arm, I caught his right wrist with both
hands.  With his freed hand he struck me
with all his remaining strength full in the
face while I twisted his right wrist with a
force that should have broken it, but which
only compelled him to relinquish the bloody
piece of steel.  And then we rolled over
again, and lay locked in each other's arms.
There was a moment's truce, for human
nature could not stand the strain.  But I
think he believed I was beaten, and at his
mercy, for he was on top of me, lying half
across ray breast, with his face not six inches
from mine.  He spoke in a horrible voice,
that shook with hate and pain and triumph.
</p>

<p>
"I've got you now&mdash;and I'll kill you, as I
did your brother!"
</p>

<p>
Great God! then it was he who had done
it, after all.  Better had it been for him to
have held his peace, for that word roused me
again as nothing else could have done, and I
caught his throat with both hands, though
he struck me viciously.  I held him as he lay
on top of me, and saw him die.  Then I
knew no more for a little while, and as I lay
there insensible, I still bled.
</p>

<p>
What was it that called me to myself?
Whether it was that my soul had gone out
to meet someone, and returned in triumph,
for I awoke with a momentary feeling of
gladness; or whether it was an unconscious
effort of the brain, in the presence of a new
and terrible danger, I cannot say.  All I
know is that, when that spasm of joy passed,
I felt weak and unable to move under the
weight of Matthias, whose protruding eyes
and tongue mocked at me hideously in death,
as though his revenge was even now being
accomplished; and I saw the fiery brush
creeping across the space that lay between
me and the fire Jim had kindled at my bidding.
Was I to die by fire at the last, when
that horrible night was passing and the
dawn was already breaking on the eastern
horizon?  For I could not stir, my limbs
were like lead, my heart beat feebly, and my
feet were cold.  I lay glaring at the fire, and,
as I did so, I saw that the revolver I had
struck out of Matthias's hand was lying as
far from the fire as the fire was from me.
How is it that there is such a clear intellect
at times in the very presence of death?  I
saw then that the shots I had fired from that
weapon had brought my enemy up just in
time, for otherwise he might have been
wearied out or lost; and now I thought if I
could only get to it, to fire it, I might thus
bring help: for what enemies had I left now
save the crawling fire?  I might even bring
Elsie.  But then, how did the dead villain
who lay across me, choking me still, get her
horse, and what had happened to her in his
hands!  I tried to scream, and I sighed as
softly as the vague wind which was impelling
the slow fires toward me.  How near
they came!&mdash;how near&mdash;and nearer yet, like
serpents rearing their heads, spitting
viciously as they came?  And then I thought
how slow they were; why did they not come
and end it at once, and let me die?  And I
looked at the fires again.  They were within
two feet of me, I could feel the heat, and
within eighteen inches of the revolver.  I
was glad, and watched it feverishly.  But
then the weapon's muzzle was pointed almost
at me.  Suppose it exploded, and shot me
dead as it called for help!  How strange it
was!  I put up my hands feebly and tried
to move the dead body, so as to screen
myself.  I might as well have tried to uproot a
tree, for I could barely move my hands.  I
looked at the fire again as it crawled on and
on, now wavering, now staying one moment
to lift up its thousand little crests and
vicious eyes, and then stooping to lick up the
grass and the dried brush on which I lay.
But as I glared at it intently, at last it
reached the weapon, and coiled round it
triumphantly as though that had been its
goal, licking it round and round.  Would
the flames heat the cartridges enough, and if
they did, where would the bullets go?  I
asked that deliriously, for I was in a fever,
and instead of being cold at heart, the blood
ran through me like fire.  I thought I began
to feel the fire that was so close to me.  I
heard the explosion of the heated weapon.
I was yet alive.  "Come, Elsie! come, if
you are not dead&mdash;come and save me&mdash;come!"  I
thought I cried out loudly, but
not even her ear, that heard a sharper sound
afar, could have caught that.  Once more and
once again the cartridges fired, and I heard a
crash, saw a horse burst like a flame through
the black brush, and there was a white thing
before my eyes.  I looked up and saw Elsie,
my own true love after all, and then I
fainted dead away, and did not recover until
long, long after.
</p>

<p>
I ask myself sometimes even now, when
those hours that were burnt into my soul
return to my sight like an old brand coming
out on the healed flesh when it is struck
sudden and sharply, whether, after all, my
enemy had been balked of his revenge.  To
die one death and go into oblivion is the lot
of all who face the rising sun, and, after a
while, veil their eyes when its last fires sink
in the western sea.  But I suffered ten
thousand deaths by violence, by cruel ambush
and torture, by crawling flames and flashing
knives in the interval between my rescue and
my recovery from the fever that my wounds
and the horror of it all brought upon me.
They told me&mdash;Elsie herself told me&mdash;that I
lay raving only ten days; but it seemed
incredible to me, as I shook my head in a
vague disbelief that made them fear for my
reason.  If I had been in the care of strangers
who were unfamiliar to me, I might have
thought myself a worn-out relic of some dead
and buried era, whose monuments had
crumbled slowly to ashes in the very fires
through which my soul had passed, shrieking
for the forgetful dead I had loved.  But
though I saw her only vaguely like a spirit
in clouds, or knew her, without sight as I lay
half unconscious, as a beneficent presence
only, I grew gradually to feel that Elsie, who
still lived after the centuries of my delirium,
loved me with the passion I had felt for her.
I say <i>had</i> felt, for I was like a child, and my
desire for her was scarcely more than a
pathetic longing for tenderness of thought
and touch, until the great strength which had
been my pride returned in a flood and
brought passion with it once more.
</p>

<p>
How strangely that came to pass which
I had foretold in my last talk with Elsie!
I had said, angrily&mdash;for I was angered&mdash;that
she should one day speak to me, though
she swore she would not, and that she should
implore my pardon.  And she did it, she who
had been so strong and self-contained, in the
meekest and dearest way the thoughts of a
maiden could devise.  And then she asked
me if I would marry her?  Would I marry
her?  I stared at her in astonishment, not at
her asking, for it seemed the most natural
thing in the world for her to do, but at the
idiocy of the Question.  "I do believe you
love me, Elsie," I said at last, "for I have
heard that love makes the most sensible
people quite stupid.  If you were in your
right senses, dear, you would not have asked it&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I should think not, indeed!" she broke
in.  But she smiled tenderly.
</p>

<p>
"Because you know very well that I
settled that long enough ago, on board the
<i>Vancouver</i>," I said stoutly.
</p>

<p>
"Then I had no voice in it?" Elsie said.
</p>

<p>
"Not the least, I assure you!  I made up
my mind."
</p>

<p>
"And so did I," said Elsie, softly.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, dear?"
</p>

<p>
She leant her head against my shoulder,
and against my big beard, and whispered:
</p>

<p>
"I made up my mind, dear Tom, that if
you didn't love me, I would never love
anyone else, but go and be a nun or a nurse all
my life.  And that's why I was so hard, you
know!"
</p>

<p>
Yes, I knew that well enough.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And where was Helen, meantime?  I am
drawing so near the end of my story that
I must say what I have to in a few words.
She had remained at the ranch until the
doctor had declared I was going to recover
(it was no fault of his that I did), and then
she went away.  What she told Elsie I have
never known, nor shall I ever ask; but they
parted good friends&mdash;yes, the best of
friends&mdash;and she returned home to Melbourne.  I
never saw her again, at least not to my
knowledge, although once, when Elsie and I
were both in that city&mdash;for I returned to my
profession&mdash;I thought, nay, for the moment I
made sure, that she had come to know of our
presence there.  For Elsie had presents of
fruit and flowers almost every day she was at
Melbourne.  I part with her now with a
strange regret, and somehow I have never
confessed to anyone that I was very vexed
at her not waiting until I was well enough
to recognize her before she went.  For, you
see, she loved me.
</p>

<p>
But&mdash;and this is the last&mdash;the time came
when I was able to go out with Elsie and
Fanny, and though we rode slowly, it did not
need rapid motion to exhilarate me when she
was by my side.  As for Fanny, she used to
lose us in the stupidest way, just as if she
had not been brought up in the bush, and
been able to follow a trail like a black fellow.
But when Harmer came out on Sundays, it
was we who lost them, for Fanny used to go
off at full speed, while Jack, who never got
used to a horse for many months, used to
risk his neck to keep up with her.  Then she
used to annoy him at night by offering him
the softest seat, which he stoutly refused,
preferring to suffer untold tortures on a
wooden stool, rather than confess.  But I
don't think they will ever imitate us, who
got married at last in the autumn at
Thomson Forks.  I invited almost everyone
I knew to the wedding, and I made Mac
my chief man, much to Jack's disgust.  I
would even have invited Montana Bill, but
he was lying in the hospital with a bullet in
his shoulder; while Hank Patterson could
not come on account of the police wanting
him for putting it there.  But half the
population of the Forks had bad headaches
next day; and if I didn't have to wear my
right hand in a sling on account of the
shaking it got, it was because I was as strong
as ever.  The only man who looked unhappy
was Mr. Fleming, and he certainly had a
right to be miserable, considering that I had
robbed him of his housekeeper, leaving him
to the tender mercies of flighty Fanny.
And she was so vicious to poor Jack that he
actually dared to say to me, "that if Elsie
had the temper of her sister, he was sorry
for me, and that it was a pity Siwash Jim and
Mat had made a mess of it."  When I
rebuked him, he said merrily, "he guessed it
was a free country, and not the poop of the
<i>Vancouver</i>."  So I let him alone, being quite
convinced then, and I have never changed
my opinion since, though we have been
married almost five years, that Elsie
Ticehurst is the best wife a man ever had,
and worth fighting for, even against the
world.

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
